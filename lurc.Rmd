# What is HPC? 
# Who uses it?

---

# Background and Defintions

* Computational Science and Engineering
    - Gain understanding, mainly through the analysis of mathematical models implemented on computers.
    - Construct mathematical models and quantitative analysis techniques, using computers to analyze and solve scientific problems.
    - Typically, these models require large amount of floating-point calculations not possible on desktops and laptops.
    -  The field&#39;s growth drove the need for HPC and benefited from it.
* High Throughput Computing (HTC): use of many computing resources over long periods of time to accomplish a computational task.
    - large number of loosely coupled tasks
* High Performance Computing (HPC): needing large amounts of computing power for short periods of time.
    - tightly coupled parallel jobs 
* Supercomputer: a computer at the frontline of current processing capacity, particularly speed of calculation.

---

# Why use HPC?

*  HPC may be the only way to achieve computational goals in a given amount of time
     - **Size**: Many problems that are interesting to scientists and engineers cannot fit on a PC usually because they need more than a few GB of RAM, or more than a few hundred GB of disk.
     - **Speed**: Many problems that are interesting to scientists and engineers would take a very long time to run on a PC: months or even years; but a problem that would take a month on a PC might only take a few hours on a supercomputer

#  Parallel Computing

* many calculations are carried out simultaneously

* based on principle that large problems can often be divided into smaller ones, which are then solved in parallel

*  Parallel computers can be roughly classified according to the level at which the hardware supports parallelism.
    - Multicore computing
    -  Symmetric multiprocessing
    -  Distributed computing
    -  Grid computing
    -  General-purpose computing on graphics processing units (GPGPU)

# Data Transfer, ScienceDMZ and Globus

* NSF funded Science DMZ to improve campus connectivity to the national research cyberinfrastructure.
* Upto 50TB storage is available on the Data Transfer Node (DTN) on ScienceDMZ.
  * Storage space is only for data transfer. Once transfer is complete, storage needs to be deleted from DTN
* Access to DTN with shell access provided on request
* [Globus](https://www.globus.org) is the preferred method to transfer data to and from NSF and DOE supercomputing centers.
  * hosted service that manages the entire operation, monitoring performance and errors, retrying failed transfers, correcting problems automatically whenever possible, and reporting status to keep you informed while you focus on your research.
  * [How to Use Globus at Lehigh?](https://researchcomputing.lehigh.edu/help/globus)
  * No special access required on DTN to transfer data via Globus


---

# HPC in the Classroom

* Research Computing Resources; Sol &amp; Ceph are available for use in registrar scheduled classes.
* 1TB Ceph space per course.
* An account per student.
   - Sol allocations are given for the whole class based on number of students.
* Accounts valid for current semester plus an additional two weeks.

* **Education, Outreach and Training is an integral part of the Hawk Cluster.**
   * Contact Alex Pacheco if you plan to use HPC for Spring 2021 courses.

# Using your own Software?


* You can always install a software in your home directory
   - [SPACK](https://spack.readthedocs.io) is an excellent package manager that can even create module files
* `Stay compliant with software licensing`
* Modify your .bashrc/.tcshrc to add software to your path, OR
* create a module and dynamically load it so that it doesn&#39;t interfere 
 with other software installed on the system
  - e.g. You might want to use openmpi instead of mvapich2 
  - the system admin may not want install it system wide for just one user
* Add the directory where you will install the module files to the variable 
  MODULEPATH in .bashrc/.tcshrc
```{sh mymodule,eval=FALSE}
# My .bashrc file
export MODULEPATH=${MODULEPATH}:/home/alp514/modulefiles
```

# How to run jobs

* All compute intensive jobs are batch scheduled
* Write a script to submit jobs to a scheduler
  - need to have some background in shell scripting (bash/tcsh)
* Need to specify
   - Resources required (which depends on configuration)
       - number of nodes
       - number of processes per node
       - memory per node
   - How long do you want the resources
       - have an estimate for how long your job will run
   - Which queue to submit jobs

# Batch Queuing System

* A software that manages resources (CPU time, memory, etc) and schedules job execution
   - Sol: Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management (SLURM)
   - Others:  Portable Batch System (PBS)
          - Scheduler: Maui
          - Resource Manager: Torque
          - Allocation Manager: Gold

# XSEDE

* The E<b>x</b>treme <b>S</b>cience and <b>E</b>ngineering <b>D</b>iscovery <b>E</b>nvironment (<strong>XSEDE</strong>) is the most advanced, powerful, and robust collection of integrated advanced digital resources and services in the world. 
* It is a single virtual system that scientists can use to interactively share computing resources, data, and expertise.
* Scientists and engineers around the world use these resources and servicesâ€”things like supercomputers, collections of data, and new toolsâ€”to make our lives healthier, safer, and better.
* XSEDE, and the experts who lead the program, will make these resources easier to use and help more people use them.
* The five-year, &#36;121-million project is supported by the National Science Foundation. 
* XSEDE is composed of multiple partner institutions known as Service Providers or SPs, each of which contributes one or more allocatable services. 
* Resources include High Performance Computing (HPC) machines, High Throughput Computing (HTC) machines, visualization, data storage, testbeds, and services.

# How do I get started on XSEDE?

* Apply for an account at the [XSEDE Portal](https://portal.xsede.org).
* There is no charge to get an XSEDE portal account.  
* You need a portal account to register for XSEDE Tutorials and Workshops
* To use XSEDE&#39;s compute and data resources, you need to have an allocation.
* An allocation on a particular resource activates your account on that allocation.
* Researchers and Educators from US universities and federal research labs can 
serve as Principle Investigators on XSEDE allocation.
* A PI can add students to his/her allocations.
* XSEDE also has a Campus Champion Program
* A XSEDE Campus Champion is a local source of knowledge about high-performance 
and high-throughput computing and other digital services, opportunities and resources. 
* A Campus Champion can request start up allocations on all XSEDE resources to help 
 local users with getting started on XSEDE resources.
