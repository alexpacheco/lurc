# What is HPC? 
# Who uses it?

---

# Background and Defintions

* Computational Science and Engineering
    * Gain understanding, mainly through the analysis of mathematical models implemented on computers.
    * Construct mathematical models and quantitative analysis techniques, using computers to analyze and solve scientific problems.
    * Typically, these models require large amount of floating-point calculations not possible on desktops and laptops.
- High Throughput Computing (HTC): use of many computing resources over long periods of time to accomplish a computational task.
    - large number of loosely coupled tasks
* High Performance Computing (HPC): needing large amounts of computing power for short periods of time.
    * tightly coupled parallel jobs. 
- Supercomputer: a computer at the frontline of current processing capacity.

---

# Why use HPC?

*  HPC may be the only way to achieve computational goals in a given amount of time

     * **Size**: Many problems that are interesting to scientists and engineers cannot fit on a PC usually because they need more than a few GB of RAM, or more than a few hundred GB of disk.

     * **Speed**: Many problems that are interesting to scientists and engineers would take a very long time to run on a PC: months or even years; but a problem that would take a month on a PC might only take a few hours on a supercomputer.

#  Parallel Computing

* many calculations are carried out simultaneously.
- based on principle that large problems can often be divided into smaller ones, which are then solved in parallel.
*  Parallel computers can be roughly classified according to the level at which the hardware supports parallelism.
    * Multicore computing
    * Symmetric multiprocessing
    * Distributed computing
    * Grid computing
    * General-purpose computing on graphics processing units (GPGPU)

# Data Transfer, ScienceDMZ and Globus

* NSF funded [Science DMZ](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1340992&HistoricalAwards=false) to improve campus connectivity to the national research cyberinfrastructure.
* Upto 50TB storage is available on the Data Transfer Node (DTN) on ScienceDMZ.
  * Storage space is only for data transfer. Once transfer is complete, storage needs to be deleted from DTN.
* Access to DTN with shell access provided on request.
* [Globus](https://www.globus.org) is the preferred method to transfer data to and from NSF and DOE supercomputing centers.
  * hosted service that manages the entire operation, monitoring performance and errors, retrying failed transfers, correcting problems automatically whenever possible, and reporting status to keep you informed while you focus on your research.
  * [How to Use Globus at Lehigh?](https://researchcomputing.lehigh.edu/help/globus)
  * No special access required on DTN to transfer data via Globus.

# HPC in the Classroom

* Sol &amp; Ceph are available for use in registrar scheduled classes.
- 1TB Ceph space per course.
* An account per student.
- 50K SUs to be shared with everyone in the class.
* Accounts valid for current semester plus an additional two weeks.

# Using your own Software?


* You can always install a software in your home directory.
   - [SPACK](https://spack.readthedocs.io) is an excellent package manager that can even create module files.
* `Stay compliant with software licensing.`
* Modify your .bashrc/.tcshrc to add software to your path, OR
* create a module and dynamically load it so that it doesn&#39;t interfere 
 with other software installed on the system.
  - e.g. You might want to use a specific version (maybe modified) of a software, and 
  - the system admin may not want install it system wide for just one user.
* Add the directory where you will install the module files to the variable 
  MODULEPATH in .bashrc/.tcshrc,
```{sh mymodule,eval=FALSE}
# My .bashrc file
export MODULEPATH=${MODULEPATH}:/home/alp514/modulefiles
```

# How to run jobs

* All compute intensive jobs are batch scheduled.
- Write a script to submit jobs to a scheduler.
  - need to have some background in shell scripting (bash/tcsh).
* Need to specify
   * Resources required (which depends on configuration):
       * number of nodes,
       * number of processes per node,
       * memory per node.
   - How long do you want the resources?
       - have an estimate for how long your job will run.
   * Which queue to submit jobs?
- More details in upcoming HPC Seminar on [SLURM](https://webapps.lehigh.edu/hpc/training/lurc/slurm.html).

# How do I get started on XSEDE?

* Apply for an account at the [XSEDE Portal](https://portal.xsede.org).
    * no charge to get an XSEDE portal account.  
    * portal account required to register for XSEDE Tutorials and Workshops.
- To use XSEDE&#39;s compute and data resources, you need to have an allocation.
   - An allocation on a particular resource activates your account on that allocation.
   - Faculty and Researchers from US universities and federal research labs can serve as Principle Investigators (PIs).
       - A PI can add students to his/her allocations.
* XSEDE also has a Campus Champion Program.
   * local source of knowledge about high-performance 
and high-throughput computing and other digital services, opportunities and resources.
   * can request start up allocations on all XSEDE resources to help local users with getting started on XSEDE resources.

# XSEDE Allocations: StartUp

* one of the fastest ways to gain access to and start using XSEDE-allocated resources.
  * recommended that all new XSEDE users begin by requesting Startup allocation.
* Appropriate uses for Startup allocations include:
  * Small-scale computational activities 
  * Application development by researchers and research teams
  * Benchmarking, evaluation and experimentation on the various resources
  * Developing a science gateway or other infrastructure software components
* subject to startup limits per resource, no more than three computational resource
- Requirements:
  - Project Abstract: describe the research objectives, explain briefly why the project needs access to XSEDE resources, state how the requested amounts were estimated, and note why the requested resources were selected.
  - CV: two page long in NIH or NSF format
  - Renewals: require progress report
- [More information](https://portal.xsede.org/allocations/startup)

# XSEDE Allocations: Education

* for academic courses or training activities that have specific begin and end dates.
  * Instructors may request a single resource or a combination of resources.
- allocation size limits as Startup requests.
  - limited to no more than three separate computational resources.
* last for the duration of the semester or training course period; 
  * may request a brief period (usually two weeks or less) after the semester or training course to allow completion of some activities.
- A Principal Investigator (PI) may request separate Educational projects for different courses happening at the same time.
* require an abstract, instructor's CV, a course syllabus, and a brief justification for the resources requested.
- [More information](https://portal.xsede.org/allocations/education)

# XSEDE Allocations: Research

- *users are encouraged to request a StartUp Allocation prior to requesting a Research Allocation.*
  - *in order to obtain benchmark results for preparing Research Allocation.*
  _ *the lack of benchmark results on the resources requested will greatly increase the level of scrutiny from the panel.*
* For projects that have progressed beyond the Startup phase, either in purpose or scale of computational activities, a Research request is appropriate. 
* Research requests are accepted and reviewed quarterly by the XSEDE Resource Allocations Committee (XRAC).
