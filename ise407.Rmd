## Background and Defintions

* Computational Science and Engineering
    - Gain understanding, mainly through the analysis of mathematical models implemented on computers.
    - Construct mathematical models and quantitative analysis techniques, using computers to analyze and solve scientific problems.
    - Typically, these models require large amount of floating-point calculations not possible on desktops and laptops.
    -  The field's growth drove the need for HPC and benefited from it.
* HPC
    - High Performance Computing (HPC) is computation at the forefront of modern technology, often done on a supercomputer. 
* Supercomputer
    -  A supercomputer is a computer at the frontline of current processing capacity, particularly speed of calculation.

--- .class

## Why use HPC?

*  HPC may be the only way to achieve computational goals in a given amount of time
     - Size: Many problems that are interesting to scientists and engineers cannot fit on a PC usually because they need more than a few GB of RAM, or more than a few hundred GB of disk.
     - Speed: Many problems that are interesting to scientists and engineers would take a very long time to run on a PC: months or even years; but a problem that would take a month on a PC might only take a few hours on a supercomputer

##  Parallel Computing

* many calculations are carried out simultaneously
*  based on principle that large problems can often be divided into smaller ones, which are then solved in parallel
*  Parallel computers can be roughly classified according to the level at which the hardware supports parallelism.
    - Multicore computing
    -  Symmetric multiprocessing
    -  Distributed computing
    -  Grid computing
    -  General-purpose computing on graphics processing units (GPGPU)

## What is Linux?

* Linux is an operating system that evolved from a kernel created by Linus Torvalds when he was a student at the University of Helsinki.
* It’s meant to be used as an alternative to other operating systems, Windows, Mac OS, MS-DOS, Solaris and others.
* Linux is the most popular OS used in a Supercomputer
   * From June 2017 Top 500 List

| OS Family | Count | Share % |
|:---------:| -----:| -------:|
| Linux | 498 | 99.6 |
| Unix  |   2 |   .4 |

* If you are using a Supercomputer/High Performance Computer for your research, it will be based on a *nix OS.
* It is required/neccessary/mandatory to learn Linux Programming (commands, shell scripting) if your research involves use of High Performance Computing or Supercomputing resources.

## Where is Linux used?

* Linux distributions are tailored to different requirements such as
  - Server
  - Desktop
  - Workstation
  -  Routers
  - Embedded devices
  -  Mobile devices (Android is a Linux-based OS)
* Almost any software that you use on windows has a roughly equivalent software on Linux, most often multiple equivalent software
  - e.g. Microsoft Office equivalents are OpenOffice.org, LibreOffice, KOffice
  - [ Visit for complete list ]
    (http://wiki.linuxquestions.org/wiki/Linux_software_equivalent_to_Windows_software)
* Linux offers you freedom, to choose your desktop environment, software.

## What is a Linux OS, Distro, Desktop Environment?

* Many software vendors release their own packaged Linux OS (kernel, applications) known as distribution
* Linux distribution = Linux kernel + GNU system utilities and libraries + Installation scripts + Management utilities etc.
    - Debian, Ubuntu, Mint
    - Red Hat, Fedora, CentOS
    - Slackware, openSUSE, SLES, SLED
    - Gentoo
* Application packages on Linux can be installed from source or from customized packages
    - deb: Debian based distros e.g. Debian, Ubuntu, Mint
    - rpm: Red Hat based distros, Slackware based distros.
* Linux distributions offer a variety of desktop environment.
    - K Desktop Environment (KDE)
    - GNOME
    - Xfce
    - Lightweight X11 Desktop Environment (LXDE)
    - Cinnamon
    - MATE
    - Dynamic Window Manager

## Difference between Shell and Command

* What is a Shell?
    - The command line interface is the primary interface to Linux/Unix operating
systems.
    - Shells are how command-line interfaces are implemented in Linux/Unix.
    - Each shell has varying capabilities and features and the user should choose the shell that best suits their needs.
    - The shell is simply an application running on top of the kernel and provides a powerful interface to the system.
* What is a command and how do you use it?
    - __command__ is a directive to a computer program acting as an interpreter of some kind,
in order to perform a specific task.
    - __command prompt__ (or just __prompt__) is a sequence of (one or more) characters used in a command-line interface to indicate readiness to accept commands.
    - Its intent is to literally prompt the user to take action.
    - A prompt usually ends with one of the characters $, %, #, :, > and often includes other information, such as the path of the current working directory.

--- .class .small

## Types of Shell

* sh : Bourne Shell
  - Developed by Stephen Bourne at AT&T Bell Labs
* csh : C Shell
  - Developed by Bill Joy at University of California, Berkeley
* ksh : Korn Shell
  - Developed by David Korn at AT&T Bell Labs
  - backward-compatible with the Bourne shell and includes many features of the C shell
* bash : Bourne Again Shell
  - Developed by Brian Fox for the GNU Project as a free software replacement for the Bourne shell (sh).
  - Default Shell on Linux and Mac OSX
* tcsh : TENEX C Shell
  - Developed by Ken Greer at Carnegie Mellon University
  - It is essentially the C shell with programmable command line completion, command-line editing, and a few other features.

## Directory Structure

* All files are arranged in a hierarchial structure, like an inverted tree.
*  The top of the hierarchy is traditionally called __root__ (written as a slash / )

<img width = '900px' src = 'assets/img/LinuxFS.png'>

--- .class

## Relative & Absolute Path
* Path means a position in the directory tree.
* You can use either the relative path or absolute path
* In relative path expression
  -  . (one dot or period) is the current working directory
  -  .. (two dots or periods) is one directory up
  -  You can combine . and .. to navigate the filee system hierarchy.
  -  the path is not defined uniquely and does depend on the current path.
  -  ../../tmp is unique only if your current working directory is your home directory.
* In absolute path expression
  -  the path is defined uniquely and does not depend on the current path
  -  /tmp is unique since /tmp is the abolute path


--- .class

## Some Linux Terms (also called variables)

* __HOME__ : Your Home Directory on the system, /home/username
  - This is where you should be when you login the first time
* __PATH__ : List of directories to search when executing a command
* __LD_LIBRARY_PATH__ : List of directories to look for libraries executing code
* __LD_INCLUDE_PATH__: List of directories to look for include files while compiling code


--- .class

## Linux Commands

* `man` shows the manual for a command or program.
  - `man pwd`
* `pwd`: print working directory, gives the absolute path of your current location in the directory hierarchy
* `cd dirname`: change to folder called `dirname`
  - If you omit directory name, you will end up in your home directory
  - Enter `cd `
* `mkdir dirname`: create a directory called `dirname`
  - Create a directory, any name you want and cd to that directory 
  - I would enter the command `mkdir ees403` followed by `cd ees403`
  - Use the `pwd` command to check your current location 
  

--- .class .small

## Linux Command (contd)

* `cp file1 file2`: command to copy file1 to file2
  - You can use absolute or relative path for the source and destination `cp ../file .`
  - If you need to copy over a directory and its contents, add a `-r flag`
  - `cp -r /home/alp514/sum2017 .`
* `rm file1`: delete a file called file1 
  - Unlike other OS's, once you delete a file it cannot be deleted.
  - Use `-r` flag to delete directories recursively
  - Use `-i` for prompt before deletion
* `ls`: list contents of current directory
  - If you provide a directory path as an argument, then the contents of that directory will be listed
* `echo`: prints whatever follows to the screen
  - `echo $HOME`: prints the contents of the variable __HOME__ i.e. your home directory to the screen
* `alias`: create a shortcut to another command or name to execute a long string.
  - `alias rm="/bin/rm -i"`


---  .class

## File Editing

* The two most commonly used editors on Linux/Unix systems are:
  -  vi or vim (vi improved)
  -  emacs
* vi/vim is installed by default on Linux/Unix systems and has only a command line interface (CLI).
* emacs has both a CLI and a graphical user interface (GUI).
* Other editors that you may come across on *nix systems
  - kate: default editor for KDE.
  - gedit: default text editor for GNOME desktop environment.
  - gvim: GUI version of vim
  - pico: console based plain text editor
  - nano: GNU.org clone of pico
  - kwrite: editor by KDE.

## File Permission

*** =left width:45%


* In *NIX OS’s, you have three types of file permissions
  - read (r)
  - write (w)
  - execute (x)
* for three types of users
  - user
  - group
  - world i.e. everyone else who has access to the system

$$ d\underbrace{rwx}_{u}\overbrace{r-x}^g\underbrace{r-x}_o $$


*** =right width:45%

```{bash echo=F}
ls -l | head -4 | tail -n +2
```
* The first character signifies type of file
  - d: directory
  - -: regular file
  - l: symbolic link
* The next three characters of first triad signifies what the owner can do
* The second triad signifies what group member can do
* The third triad signifies what everyone else can do

--- .class #id .tiny

## File Permission

* Read carries a weight of 4
* Write carries a weight of 2
* Execute carries a weight of 1
* The weights are added to give a value of 7 (rwx), 6(rw), 5(rx) or 3(wx) permissions.
* `chmod` is a *NIX command to change permissions on a file
* To give user rwx, group rx and world x permission, the command is
  -  `chmod 751 filename`
* Instead of using numerical permissions you can also use symbolic mode
  - u/g/o or a user/group/world or all i.e. ugo
  - +/- Add/remove permission
  - r/w/x read/write/execute
* Give everyone execute permission:
  - `chmod a+x hello.sh`
  - `chmod ugo+x hello.sh`
* Remove group and world read & write permission:
  - `chmod go-rw hello.sh`

--- .class #id 


## Scripting Language

* A __scripting language__ or __script language__ is a _programming language_ that supports
the writing of scripts.
* __Scripting Languages__ provide a higher level of abstraction than standard
programming languages.
* Compared to programming languages, scripting languages do not distinguish between
data types: integers, real values, strings, etc.
* Scripting Languages tend to be good for automating the execution of other programs.
   - analyzing data
   - running daily backups
* They are also good for writing a program that is going to be used only once and then
discarded.
* A __script__ is a program written for a software environment that automate the execution
of tasks which could alternatively be executed one-by-one by a human operator.
* The majority of script programs are “quick and dirty”, where the main goal is to get
the program written quickly.


--- .class #id

## Writing your first script

* Write a script
   * A shell script is a file that contains ASCII text.
   * Create a file, hello.sh with the following lines

```{bash echo=F}
cat hello.sh
```

* Set permissions

```{bash eval=F}
chmod +x hello.sh
```

* Execute the script

```{bash eval=F}
./hello.sh
```

```{bash echo=F}
sh ./hello.sh
```

--- .class #id

## Breaking down the script

* My First Script

```{bash echo=F}
cat hello.sh
```

* The first line is called the ”ShaBang” line. It tells the OS which interpreter to use. In
the current example, bash
* Other options are:
   * sh : #!/bin/sh
   * ksh : #!/bin/ksh
   * csh : #!/bin/csh
   * tcsh: #!/bin/tcsh
* The second line is a comment. All comments begin with ”#”.
* The third line tells the OS to print ”Hello World!” to the screen.
* Slides written in R Markdown. ## in orange implies screen output

--- .class #id

## Quotation

* Double Quotation " "
   * Enclosed string is expanded 
* Single Quotation ' '
   * Enclosed string is read literally
* Back Quotation &grave;  &grave;
   * Used for command substitution
   * Enclosed string is executed as a command
   * In bash, you can also use \$( ) instead of &grave;  &grave;

```{bash}
myvar=hello
myname=Alex
echo "$myvar $myname"
echo '$myvar $myname'
echo $(pwd)
```

--- .class #id

## Arithmetic Operations


| Operation | Operator | Example |
|:---------:|:--------:|:-------:|
| Addition | + | `$((1+2))`
| Subtraction | - | `let c=$a-$b`
| Multiplication | * | `$[$a*$b]` |
| Division | / | `` `expr $a/$b` ``
| Exponentiation | ** | `2**3` |
| Modulo | % | `let c%=5` |

* You can use C-style increment operators (`let c++`)
* Only integer arithmetic works in bash
* Use `bc` or `awk` for floating point arithmetic
   - `echo "3.8 + 4.2" | bc`
   - `echo "scale=5; 2/5" | bc`
   - `bc <<< "scale=5; 2/5"`
   - `echo 3.8 4.2 | awk '{print $1*$2}'`


--- .class #id

## Flow Control

* Shell Scripting Languages execute commands in sequence similar to programming languages such as C, Fortran, etc.
* Control constructs can change the sequential order of commands.
   - Conditionals: `if`
   - Loops: `for`, `while`, `until`

--- .class .tiny

## Conditionals: if

* An `if ... then` construct tests whether the exit status of a condition is 0, and if so, executes one or more commands.

```{bash eval=F}
if [ condition1 ]; then
  some commands
fi
```

* if the exit status of a condition is non-zero, `bash` allows a `if ... then ... else` construct

```{bash eval=F}
if [ condition1 ]; then
  some commands
else
  some commands
fi
```

* You can also add another if statement i.e. else if or `elif` if you want to check another conditional

```{bash eval=F}
if [ condition1 ]; then
  some commands
elif [ condition2 ]; then
  some commands
else
  some commands
fi
```

--- .class

## Comparison operators

* integers and strings

| Operation | Integer | String |
|:---------:|:-------:|:------:|
| equal to | `if [ 1 -eq 2 ]` | `if [ $a == $b ]` |
| not equal to | `if [ $a -ne $b ]` | `if [ $a != $b ]` |
| greater than | `if [ $a -gt $b ]` | |
| greater than or equal to | `if [ 1 -ge $b ]` | |
| less than | `if [ $a -lt 2 ]` | |
| less than or equal to | `if [[ $a -le $b ]]` | |
| zero length or null | | `if [ -z $a ]` |
| non zero length | | `if [ -n $a ]` |



--- .class .tiny

## Other Operators

* File Test Operators

| Operation | Example |
|:---------:|:-------:|
| file exists | `if [ -e .bashrc ]` |
| file is a regular file | `if [ -f .bashrc ]` |
| file is a directory | `if [ -d /home ]` |
| file is not zero size | `if [ -s .bashrc ]` |
| file has read permission | `if [ -r .bashrc ]` |
| file has write permission | `if [ -w .bashrc ]` |
| file has execute permission | `if [ -x .bashrc ]` |

* Logical Operators

| Operation | Example |
|:---------:|:-------:|
| NOT | `if [ ! -e .bashrc ]` |
| AND | `if [ $a -eq 2 ] && [ $x -gt $y ]` |
| OR | markdown display error, see next slide for example |

--- .class #id

## Nested ifs

* `if` statements can be nested and/or simplied using logical operators

```{bash eval=F}
if [ $a -gt 0 ]; then
  if [ $a -lt 5 ]; then
    echo "The value of a lies somewhere between 0 and 5"
  fi
fi

if [[ $a -gt 0 && $a -lt 5 ]]
  echo "The value of a lies somewhere between 0 and 5"
fi 

if [[ $a -gt 0 || $x -lt 5 ]]
  echo "a is positive or x is less than 5"
fi
```

--- .class #id

## Loops

* A _loop_ is a block of code that iterates a list of commands.
* __bash__ provides three _loop constructs_
* `for` is the basic loop construct

```{bash eval=F}
for arg in list
do
  some commands
done
```

* `while` (`until`) tests for a condition at the top of a loop, and keeps looping as
long as that condition is true (false)

```{bash eval=F}
while [ condition ]; do
  some commands
done
```

```{bash eval=F}
until [ condition ]; do
  some commands
done
```

## Arrays

* Array elements may be initialized with the __variable[xx]__ notation
  `variable[xx]=1`
* Initialize an array during declaration
  `name=(firstname 'last name')`
* reference an element i of an array name
   `${name[i]}`
* print the whole array
   `${name[@]}`
* print length of array
   `${#name[@]}`
* print length of element i of array name
  `${#name[i]}`
* `${#name}` prints the length of the first element of the array
* Add an element to an existing array
   `name=(title ${name[@]})`
* copy an array name to an array user
   `user=(${name[@]})`
* concatenate two arrays
   `nameuser=(${name[@]} ${user[@]})`
* delete an entire array
   `unset name`
* remove an element i from an array
   `unset name[i]`
* the first array index is zero (0)

--- .class

## Command Line Arguments

* Similar to programming languages, bash (and other shell scripting languages) can also take command line arguments
   * `./scriptname arg1 arg2 arg3 arg4 ...`
   * `$0,$1,$2,$3, etc`: positional parameters corresponding to
   * `./scriptname,arg1,arg2,arg3,arg4,...` respectively
   * for more than 9 arguments, position parameters need to be protected for e.g. `${10}` OR
   * use `shift N`: shift positional parameters from `N+1` to `$#` are renamed to variable names from `$1` to `$# - N + 1`
   * `$#`: number of command line arguments
   * `$*`: all of the positional parameters, seen as a single word
   * `$@`: same as `$*` but each parameter is a quoted string.


--- .class

## Example - Command Line Arguments

```{bash eval=F}
#!/bin/bash
USAGE="USAGE: $0 <at least 1 argument>"
if [[ "$#" -lt 1 ]]; then
   echo $USAGE
   exit
fi
echo "Number of Arguments: " $#
echo "List of Arguments: " $@
echo "Name of script that you are running: " $0
echo "Command You Entered:" $0 $*
while [ "$#"  -gt 0 ]; do
  echo "Argument List is: " $@
  echo "Number of Arguments: " $#
  shift 
done
```

```{bash}
sh ./shift.sh $(seq 1 3)
```

--- .class

## Functions

* Like ”real” programming languages, bash has functions.
* A function is a subroutine, a code block that implements a set of operations, a ”black box” that performs a specified task.
* Wherever there is repetitive code, when a task repeats with only slight variations in procedure, then consider using a function.

```{bash eval=F}
function function_name {
  somecommands
}

OR

function_name () {
  some commands
}
```

echo "Number of Arguments: " $#
echo "List of Arguments: " $@
echo "Name of script that you are running: " $0
echo "Command You Entered:" $0 $*
echo "First Argument" $1
echo "Tenth and Eleventh argument" $10 $11 ${10} ${11}

sh ./shift10.sh $(seq 1 10)
```

```{bash}
sh ./shift10.sh $(seq 0 2 30) 
```

--- .class

## Function Arguments

* You can also pass arguments to a function.
* All function parameters or arguments can be accessed via `$1, $2, $3,..., $N`.
* `$0` always point to the shell script name.
* `$*` or `$@` holds all parameters or arguments passed to the function.
* `$#` holds the number of positional parameters passed to the function.
* Array variable called `FUNCNAME` contains the names of all shell functions currently in the execution call stack.
* By default all variables are global.
* Modifying a variable in a function changes it in the whole script.
* You can create a local variables using the local command

```{bash eval=F}
local var=value
local varName
``` 

--- .class &twocol_width

## Recursive Function

* A function may recursively call itself.

*** =left width:45%

```{bash eval=F}
#!/bin/bash
usage () {  echo "USAGE: $0 <integer>" ;   exit }

## What about Storage resources

* LTS provides various storage options for research and teaching
* Some are cloud based and subject to Lehigh's Cloud Policy
* For research, LTS is deploying a 600TB refreshed Ceph storage system
* Ceph is based on the Ceph software
* Research groups can purchase a sharable project space on Ceph @ &#36;375/TB for 5 year duration
* Ceph is in-house, built, operated and administered by LTS Research Computing Staff.
  - located in Data Center in EWFM with a backup cluster in Packard Lab
* HPC users can write job output directly to their Ceph volume
* Ceph volume can be mounted as a network drive on Windows or CIFS on Mac and Linux
  - [See Ceph FAQ] (http://lts.lehigh.edu/services/faq/ceph-faq) for more details
* Storage quota on
  - Maia: 5GB
  - Sol: 150GB

--- .class

## How do I get started using HPC resources?

* Login to sol: `ssh -X username@sol.cc.lehigh.edu`
   - You should see something like `[alp514@sol ~]$ ` if you are logged
     into sol
   - This is known as the command prompt
   - sol is the head/login and storage node for the monocacy cluster. 
   - __Do not run computation on this node.__
   - Editing files, compiling code are acceptable computation on this node.
   - Running intense computation on this node causes a high load on the storage
     that would cause other users jobs to run slow.
   - All compute nodes are labelled as sol-[a-e][1-6][01-18]
      - [a-e] for each distinct type of node
      - [1-6] is the rack number in the HPC row
      - [01-18] is the location in the rack with 01 at the bottom and 18 at the
        top

## Available Software

* Commercial, Free and Open source software is installed on
  - [Maia](https://webapps.lehigh.edu/dokuwiki/sites/researchcomputing/doku.php?id=maia#installed_software): /zhome/Apps
  - [Sol](https://webapps.lehigh.edu/dokuwiki/sites/researchcomputing/doku.php?id=sol#installed_software): /share/Apps
* Software is managed using module environment
  - Why? We may have different versions of same software or software built with different compilers
  - Module environment allows you to dynamically change your *nix environment based on software being used
  - Standard on many University and national High Performance Computing resource since circa 2011
* How to use Sol/Maia Software on your [linux](https://webapps.lehigh.edu/dokuwiki/sites/researchcomputing/doku.php?id=linux) workstation

## Using your own Software?


* You can always install a software in your home directory
   - [SPACK](https://spack.readthedocs.io) is an excellent package manager that can even create module files
* `Stay compliant with software licensing`
* Modify your .bashrc/.tcshrc to add software to your path, OR
* create a module and dynamically load it so that it doesn't interfere 
 with other software installed on the system
  - e.g. You might want to use openmpi instead of mvapich2 
  - the system admin may not want install it system wide for just one user
* Add the directory where you will install the module files to the variable 
  MODULEPATH in .bashrc/.tcshrc
```{sh eval=FALSE}
# My .bashrc file
export MODULEPATH=${MODULEPATH}:/home/alp514/modulefiles
```

## Cluster Environment

* A cluster is a group of computers (nodes) that works together closely

*** =left width:30%

* Two types of nodes
   - Head/Login Node
   - Compute Node

* Multi-user environment

* Each user may have multiple jobs running simultaneously

--- .class #id

## How to run jobs

* All compute intensive jobs are scheduled
* Write a script to submit jobs to a scheduler
  - need to have some background in shell scripting (bash/tcsh)
* Need to specify
   - Resources required (which depends on configuration)
       - number of nodes
       - number of processes per node
       - memory per node
   - How long do you want the resources
       - have an estimate for how long your job will run
   - Which queue to submit jobs
       - SLURM uses the term _partition_ instead of _queue_


--- .class #id

## Scheduler &amp; Resource Management

* A software that manages resources (CPU time, memory, etc) and schedules job execution
   - Sol: Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management (SLURM)
   - Others:  Portable Batch System (PBS)
          - Scheduler: Maui
          - Resource Manager: Torque
          - Allocation Manager: Gold

* A job can be considered as a user’s request to use a certain amount of resources for a certain amount of time

* The Scheduler or queuing system determines
    - The order jobs are executed
    - On which node(s) jobs are executed



--- .class #id &twocol_width
 
## Job Scheduling

*** =left width:50%

* Map jobs onto the node-time space
    - Assuming CPU time is the only resource

* Need to find a balance between
    - Honoring the order in which jobs are received
    - Maximizing resource utilization


*** =right width:45%

## Backfilling

*** =left width:50%
* A strategy to improve utilization
   - Allow a job to jump ahead of others when there are enough idle nodes
   - Must not affect the estimated start time of the job with the highest priority

## How much time must I request

* Ask for an amount of time that is
    - Long enough for your job to complete
    - As short as possible to increase the chance of backfilling

## How much memory can or should I use per core?

* The amount of installed memory less the amount that is used by the operating system and other utilities

* A general rule of thumb on most HPC resources: leave 1-2GB for the OS to run. 

* Sol

| Partition | Max Memory/core (GB) | Recommended Memory/Core (GB) |
|:---------:|:--------------------:|:----------------------------:|
| lts | 6.4 | 6.2 |
| eng/imlab/imlab-gpu/enge/engi | 5.3 | 5.1 |
| engc | 2.66 | 2.4 |
| himem | 32 | 31.5 |


*  <span class="alert">if you need to run a single core job that requires 10GB memory in the imlab partition, you need to request 2 cores even though you are only using
         1 core.</span>  

* Maia: Users need to specify memory required in their submit script. Max
memory that should be requested is 126GB.

## Basic Job Manager Commands

* Submission
* Monitoring
* Manipulating
* Reporting

--- .class 

## Job Types

* Interactive Jobs
  - Set up an interactive environment on compute nodes for users
  - Will log you into a compute node and wait for your prompt
  - Purpose: testing and debugging code. __Do not run jobs on head node!!!__
      * All compute node have a naming convention __sol-[a,b,c,d,e]###__
      * head node is __sol__
* Batch Jobs
   - Executed using a batch script without user intervention
       - Advantage: system takes care of running the job
       - Disadvantage: cannot change sequence of commands after submission
   - Useful for Production runs
   - Workflow: write a script -> submit script -> take mini vacation ->
   analyze results

## Useful SLURM Directives (contd)

| SLURM Directive | Description |
|:---------------:|:-----------:|
|  --qos=nogpu | Request a quality of service (qos)  for the job in `imlab`, `engc` partitions. |
| | Job will remain in queue indefinitely if you do not specify qos |
|  --gres=gpu:# | Specifies number of gpus requested in the gpu partitions |
| | You can request 1 or 2 gpus with a minimum of 1 core or cpu per gpu |

## SLURM Filename Patterns

* sbatch allows for a filename pattern to contain one or more replacement
  symbols, which are a percent sign "%" followed by a letter (e.g. %j). 

| Pattern | Description |
|:-------:|:-----------:|
| %A |    Job array's master job allocation number. |
| %a |    Job array ID (index) number. |
| %J |    jobid.stepid of the running job. (e.g. "128.0") |
| %j |    jobid of the running job. |
| %N |    short hostname. This will create a separate IO file per node. |
| %n |    Node identifier relative to current job (e.g. "0" is the first node of the running job) This will create a separate IO file per node. |
| %s |    stepid of the running job. |
| %t |    task identifier (rank) relative to current job. This will create a separate IO file per task. |
| %u |    User name. |
| %x |    Job name. |

## Job Types: Interactive

   - PBS: Use `qsub -I` command with PBS Directives
       *    `qsub -I -V -l walltime=<hh:mm:ss>,nodes=<# of nodes>:ppn=<# of core/node> -q <queue
   name>`

   - SLURM:  Use `srun` command with SLURM Directives followed by `--pty /bin/bash`
       * `srun --time=<hh:mm:ss> --nodes=<# of nodes> --ntasks-per-node=<#
   of core/node> -p <queue name> --pty /bin/bash`
       * If you have `soltools` module loaded, then use `interact` with at
   least one SLURM Directive
           - `interact -t 20` [Assumes `-p lts -n 1 -N 20`]
   - Run a job interactively replace `--pty /bin/bash --login` with the
     appropriate command. 
       - For e.g. `srun -t 20 -n 1 -p imlab --qos=nogpu $(which lammps) -in in.lj
     -var x 1 -var n 1`
       - Default values are 3 days, 1 node, 20 tasks per node and lts
   partition

## Job Types: Batch 

* Workflow: write a script -> submit script -> take mini vacation -> analyze
  results
* Batch scripts are written in bash, tcsh, csh or sh
   * ksh scripts will work if ksh is installed
* Add PBS or SLURM directives after the shebang line but before any shell
  commands
   * SLURM: `#SBATCH DIRECTIVES`
   * PBS: `#PBS DIRECTIVES` 
* Submitting Batch Jobs
   * PBS: `qsub filename`
   * SLURM: `sbatch filename`

* `qsub` and `sbatch` can take the options for `#PBS` and `#SBATCH` as command line arguments
   * `qsub -l walltime=1:00:00,nodes=1:ppn=16 -q normal filename`
   * `sbatch --time=1:00:00 --nodes=1 --ntasks-per-node=20 -p lts filename`

## Need to run multiple jobs in sequence?

* Option 1: Submit jobs as soon as previous jobs complete
* Option 2: Submit jobs with a dependency
    * [SLURM](https://webapps.lehigh.edu/dokuwiki/sites/researchcomputing/doku.php?id=slurm#submitting_dependency_jobs):
  `sbatch --dependency=afterok:<JobID> <Submit Script>`
    * [PBS](https://webapps.lehigh.edu/dokuwiki/sites/researchcomputing/doku.php?id=corona#submitting_dependency_jobs):
  `qsub -W depend=afterok:<JobID> <Submit Script>`

* You want to run several serial processor jobs on
    * one node: your submit script should be able to run several serial
    jobs in background and then use the `wait` command for all jobs to finish
    * more than one node: this requires some background in scripting but the
    idea is the same as above

## Monitoring &amp; Manipulating Jobs


| SLURM Command | Description | PBS Command |
|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-------------:|
| squeue | check job status (all jobs) | qstat |
| squeue -u username | check job status of user <em>username</em> | qstat -u username |
| squeue --start | Show <strong>estimated</strong> start time of jobs in queue | showstart jobid |
| scontrol show job jobid | Check status of your job identified by <em>jobid</em> | checkjob jobid |
| scancel jobid | Cancel your job identified by <em>jobid</em> | qdel jobid |
| scontrol hold jobid | Put your job identified by <em>jobid</em> on hold | qhold jobid |
| scontrol release jobid | Release the hold that <strong>you put</strong> on <em>jobid | qrls jobid |

* The following scripts written by RC staff can also be used for monitoring
  jobs. 
   * __checkq__: `squeue` with additional useful option. 
   * __checkload__: `sinfo` with additional options to show load on compute nodes.  
* load the `soltools` module to get access to RC staff created scripts

## Modifying Resources for Queued Jobs

* Modify a job after submission but before starting: 
    * `scontrol update SPECIFICATION jobid=<jobid>`
* Examples of `SPECIFICATION` are
    * add dependency after a job has been submitted: `dependency=<attributes>`
    * change job name: `jobname=<name>`
    * change partition: `partition=<name>`
    * modify requested runtime: `timelimit=<hh:mm:ss>`
    * change quality of service (when changing to imlab/engc): `qos=nogpu` 
    * request gpus (when changing to one of the gpu partitions): `gres=gpu:<1 or 2>`
* SPECIFICATIONs can be combined for e.g. command to move a queued job to `imlab` partition and change timelimit to 48 hours for a job 123456 is
   * `scontrol update partition=imlab qos=nogpu timelimit=48:00:00 jobid=123456`

* [sshare](http://slurm.schedmd.com/sshare.html): Tool for listing the shares of associations to a cluster. 

* We have created scripts based on these to provide usage reporting
    -  `alloc_summary.sh`
        - included in your .bash_profile
        - prints allocation usage on your login shell
    -  `balance`
        - prints allocation usage summary
    -  `solreport`
        - obtain your monthly usage report
        - PIs can obtain usage report for all or specific users on their
	allocation
        - use `--help` for usage information
