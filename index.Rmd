## Allocation Charges, Effective Oct. 1, 2016

* Cost per core-hour or service unit (SU) is 1&cent;
* SU is defined as 1 hour of computing on 1 core of the Sol base compute node.
   - One base compute node of Sol consumes 20 SU/hour, 480 SU/day and 175,200 SU/year
* No free usage if allocation balance is zero


* PIs can share allocations with their collaborators
   - Minimum Annual Purchase of 50,000 SU - &#36;500/year
   - Additional Increments of 10,000 SU - &#36;100 per 10K increments
   - Fixed Allocation cycle: Oct 1 - Sep 30
   - Unused allocations do not rollover to next allocation cycle
   - <em>Working on implementing a rolling allocation cycle, only for minimum purchase.</em>
   - Total available computing time for purchase annually: 1.4M SUs or 1 year of continous computing on 8 nodes

--- .lehigh

## Example Allocation Request

- PI requires 100K SUs of computing time per year
<ul class="unilist">
  <li><span class="unibull">&#x2776;</span> One Purchase:
     <ul><li> 100K SU for &#36;1000/year</li></ul>
  </li>
  <li><span class="unibull">&#x2777;</span>Multiple Purchases:
     <ul><li> Initial 50K SUs for &#36;500/year.</li>
     <li> Multiple additional purchases of 10K SUs for &#36;100 each as required.</li></ul>
  </li>
</ul>
* All 100K SUs (<span class="txtbull">&#x2776;</span> and <span class="txtbull">&#x2777;</span>) must be used up by Sep. 30 of next year.
     * If rolling allocation cycle is implemented, then all 100K SUs (<span class="txtbull">&#x2776;</span> and <span class="txtbull">&#x2777;</span>) must be used up within 1 year of initial 50K purchase.

* Need more than 175K SU/year or
* Do not think 1.4M SUs are enough for all HPC users, then
* BECOME A CONDO INVESTOR
 

--- .lehigh

## Condo Investments

* New sustainable model for High Performance Computing at Lehigh
* Faculty (Condo Investor) purchase compute nodes from grants to increase overall capacity of Sol
* LTS will provide for four years
   - System Administration, Power and Cooling, User Support for Condo Investments
* Condo Investor
   - receives annual allocation equivalent to their investment for four years
   - can utilize allocations on all available nodes, including nodes from other Condo Investors
   - allows idle cycles on investment to be used by other Sol users
   - unused allocation will not rollover to the next allocation cycle.
   - can purchase additional SUs in 10K increments (minimum 50K not required)
       -  and must be consumed in current allocation cycle
* Annual Allocation cycle is Oct. 1 - Sep. 30.

## Accessing Research Computing Resources

* All Research Computing resources are accessible using ssh while on Lehigh's network
* Sol: `ssh username@sol.cc.lehigh.edu`
* Maia: No direct access to Maia, instead login to the polaris
* Polaris: `ssh username@polaris.cc.lehigh.edu`
  - Polaris is a gateway that also hosts the batch scheduler for Maia.
  - No computing software including compilers is available on Polaris.
  - Login to Polaris and request computing time on Maia including interactive access.
* If you are not on Lehigh's network, login to the ssh gateway to get to Research Computing resources.
  - `ssh username@ssh.cc.lehigh.edu`

## Storage resources

* LTS provides various storage options for research and teaching..
* Some are cloud based and subject to Lehigh's Cloud Policy
* For research, LTS provides a 1PB storage system called Ceph
* Ceph is based on the Ceph software
* Research groups can purchase a sharable project space on Ceph @ $200/TB/year
* Ceph is in-house, built, operated and administered by LTS Research Computing Staff.
  - located in Data Center in EWFM with a backup cluster in Packard Lab
* HPC users can write job output directly to their Ceph volume
* Ceph volume can be mounted as a network drive on Windows or CIFS on Mac and Linux
  - [See Ceph FAQ] (http://lts.lehigh.edu/services/faq/ceph-faq) for more details
* Storage quota on
  - Maia: 5GB
  - Sol: 150GB

## Available Software

* Commercial and Free, Open source software is installed on
  - Maia: /zhome/Apps
  - Sol: /share/Apps
* Software is managed using module environment
  - Why? We may have different versions of same software or software built with different compilers
  - Module environment allows you to dynamically change your *nix environment based on software being used
  - Standard on many University and national High Performance Computing resource since circa 2011

* Modify your .bashrc/.tcshrc to add software to your path, OR
* create a module and dynamically load it so that it doesn't interfere 
 with other software installed on the system
  - e.g. You might want to use openmpi instead of mvapich2 
  - the system admin may not want install it system wide for just one user
* Add the directory where you will install the module files to the variable 
  MODULEPATH in .bashrc/.tcshrc
```{sh eval=FALSE}
# My .bashrc file
export MODULEPATH=${MODULEPATH}:/home/alp514/modulefiles

## XSEDE

* The E<b>x</b>treme <b>S</b>cience and <b>E</b>ngineering <b>D</b>iscovery <b>E</b>nvironment (<strong>XSEDE</strong>) is the most advanced, powerful, and robust collection of integrated advanced digital resources and services in the world. 

* It is a single virtual system that scientists can use to interactively share computing resources, data, and expertise.

* Scientists and engineers around the world use these resources and services—things like supercomputers, collections of data, and new tools—to make our lives healthier, safer, and better. 

* XSEDE, and the experts who lead the program, will make these resources easier to use and help more people use them.

## How do I get started on XSEDE?

* Apply for an account at the [XSEDE Portal](https://portal.xsede.org).
* There is no charge to get an XSEDE portal account.  
* You need a portal account to register for XSEDE Tutorials and Workshops
* To use XSEDE's compute and data resources, you need to have an allocation.
* An allocation on a particular resource activates your account on that allocation.
* Researchers and Educators from US universities and federal research labs can 
serve as Principle Investigators on XSEDE allocation.
* A PI can add students to his/her allocations.
* XSEDE also has a Campus Champion Program
* A XSEDE Campus Champion is a local source of knowledge about high-performance 
and high-throughput computing and other digital services, opportunities and resources. 
* A Campus Champion can request start up allocations on all XSEDE resources to help 
 local users with getting started on XSEDE resources.
