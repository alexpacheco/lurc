   * `ssh username@monocacy.cc.lehigh.edu`
* Maia: No direct access to Maia, instead login to Polaris
  - `ssh username@polaris.cc.lehigh.edu`
  - Polaris is a gateway that also hosts the batch scheduler for Maia
  - No computing software including compilers is available on Polaris
  - Login to Polaris and request computing time on Maia including interactive access
      - On Polaris, run the `maiashell` command to get interactive access to
        Maia for 15 minutes.
* If you are not on Lehigh's network, login to the ssh gateway to get to Research Computing resources
  - `ssh username@ssh.cc.lehigh.edu`

--- .class

## What about Storage resources

* LTS provides various storage options.
* Some of these are in the cloud and subject to Lehigh's Cloud Policy
* For research, LTS provides a 1PB storage system called Ceph
* Ceph is based on the Ceph software
* Research groups can purchase a project space on Ceph @ $200/TB/year that can be shared
* Ceph is in-house, built, operated and administered by LTS Research Computing Staff.
  - located in Data Center in EWFM with a backup cluster in Packard Lab
* HPC users can write job output directly to their Ceph volume
* Ceph volume can be mounted as a network drive on Windows or CIFS on Mac and Linux
  - [See Ceph FAQ] (http://lts.lehigh.edu/services/faq/ceph-faq) for more details
* HPC User home directory quota
  - Maia: 5GB
  - Sol: 150GB

--- .class

## How do I get started using HPC resources for this course

* Login to monocacy: `ssh -X username@monocacy.cc.lehigh.edu`

* Linux is the Operating System installed on all HPC resources.
   - You should see something like `[alp514@monocacy1 ~]$ ` if you are logged
     into monocacy
   - This is known as the command prompt
   - Monocacy1 is the head/login and storage node for the monocacy cluster. 
   - __Do not run computation on this node.__
   - Editing files, compiling code are acceptable computation on this node.
   - Running intense computation on this node causes a high load on the storage
     that would cause other users jobs to run slow.

## What is Linux?

* Linux is an operating system that evolved from a kernel created by Linus Torvalds when he was a student at the University of Helsinki.
* It’s meant to be used as an alternative to other operating systems, Windows, Mac OS, MS-DOS, Solaris and others.
* Linux is the most popular OS used in a Supercomputer

| OS Family | Count | Share % |
|:---------:| -----:| -------:|
| Linux | 498 | 99.6 |
| Unix  |   2 |   .4 |

* If you are using a Supercomputer/High Performance Computer for your research, it will be based on a *nix OS.
* It is required/neccessary/mandatory to learn Linux Programming (commands, shell scripting) if your research involves use of High Performance Computing or Supercomputing resources.

--- .class

## Where is Linux used?

* Linux distributions are tailored to different requirements such as
  - Server
  - Desktop
  - Workstation
  -  Routers
  - Embedded devices
  -  Mobile devices (Android is a Linux-based OS)
* Almost any software that you use on windows has a roughly equivalent software on Linux, most often multiple equivalent software
  - e.g. Microsoft Office equivalents are OpenOffice.org, LibreOffice, KOffice
  - [ Visit for complete list ]
    (http://wiki.linuxquestions.org/wiki/Linux_software_equivalent_to_Windows_software)
* Linux offers you freedom, to choose your desktop environment, software.

--- .class .tiny

## What is a Linux OS, Distro, Desktop Environment?

* Many software vendors release their own packaged Linux OS (kernel, applications) known as distribution
* Linux distribution = Linux kernel + GNU system utilities and libraries + Installation scripts + Management utilities etc.
    - Debian, Ubuntu, Mint
    - Red Hat, Fedora, CentOS
    - Slackware, openSUSE, SLES, SLED
    - Gentoo
* Application packages on Linux can be installed from source or from customized packages
    - deb: Debian based distros e.g. Debian, Ubuntu, Mint
    - rpm: Red Hat based distros, Slackware based distros.
* Linux distributions offer a variety of desktop environment.
    - K Desktop Environment (KDE)
    - GNOME
    - Xfce
    - Lightweight X11 Desktop Environment (LXDE)
    - Cinnamon
    - MATE
    - Dynamic Window Manager

--- .class .small

## Difference between Shell and Command

* What is a Shell?
    - The command line interface is the primary interface to Linux/Unix operating
systems.
    - Shells are how command-line interfaces are implemented in Linux/Unix.
    - Each shell has varying capabilities and features and the user should choose the shell that best suits their needs.
    - The shell is simply an application running on top of the kernel and provides a powerful interface to the system.
* What is a command and how do you use it?
    - __command__ is a directive to a computer program acting as an interpreter of some kind,
in order to perform a specific task.
    - __command prompt__ (or just __prompt__) is a sequence of (one or more) characters used in a command-line interface to indicate readiness to accept commands.
    - Its intent is to literally prompt the user to take action.
    - A prompt usually ends with one of the characters $, %, #, :, > and often includes other information, such as the path of the current working directory.

--- .class .small

## Types of Shell

* sh : Bourne Shell
  - Developed by Stephen Bourne at AT&T Bell Labs
* csh : C Shell
  - Developed by Bill Joy at University of California, Berkeley
* ksh : Korn Shell
  - Developed by David Korn at AT&T Bell Labs
  - backward-compatible with the Bourne shell and includes many features of the C shell
* bash : Bourne Again Shell
  - Developed by Brian Fox for the GNU Project as a free software replacement for the Bourne shell (sh).
  - Default Shell on Linux and Mac OSX
* tcsh : TENEX C Shell
  - Developed by Ken Greer at Carnegie Mellon University
  - It is essentially the C shell with programmable command line completion, command-line editing, and a few other features.


--- .class

## Directory Structure

* All files are arranged in a hierarchial structure, like an inverted tree.
*  The top of the hierarchy is traditionally called __root__ (written as a slash / )

<img width = '900px' src = 'assets/img/LinuxFS.png'>

--- .class

## Relative & Absolute Path
* Path means a position in the directory tree.
* You can use either the relative path or absolute path
* In relative path expression
  -  . (one dot or period) is the current working directory
  -  .. (two dots or periods) is one directory up
  -  You can combine . and .. to navigate the filee system hierarchy.
  -  the path is not defined uniquely and does depend on the current path.
  -  ../../tmp is unique only if your current working directory is your home directory.
* In absolute path expression
  -  the path is defined uniquely and does not depend on the current path
  -  /tmp is unique since /tmp is the abolute path


--- .class

## Some Linux Terms (also called variables)

* __HOME__ : Your Home Directory on the system, /home/username
  - This is where you should be when you login the first time
  - Don't believe me, type `pwd` and hit enter
* __PATH__ : List of directories to search when executing a command
  - Enter `avogadro` at the command prompt
  - You should see an error saying `command not found`
* __LD_LIBRARY_PATH__ : List of directories to look for libraries executing code



--- .class

## Linux Commands

* `man` shows the manual for a command or program.
  - `man pwd`
* `pwd`: print working directory, gives the absolute path of your current location in the directory hierarchy
* `cd dirname`: change to folder called `dirname`
  - If you omit directory name, you will end up in your home directory
  - Enter `cd `
* `mkdir dirname`: create a directory called `dirname`
  - Create a directory, any name you want and cd to that directory 
  - I would enter the command `mkdir ees403` followed by `cd ees403`
  - Use the `pwd` command to check your current location 
  

--- .class

## Linux Command (contd)

* `cp file1 file2`: command to copy file1 to file2
  - You can use absolute or relative path for the source and destination `cp ../file .`
  - If you need to copy over a directory and its contents, add a `-r flag`
  - `cp -r /home/alp514/sum2017 .`
* `rm file1`: delete a file called file1 
  - Unlike other OS's, once you delete a file it cannot be deleted.
* `ls`: list contents of current directory
  - If you provide a directory path as an argument, then the contents of that directory will be listed
* `echo`: prints whatever follows to the screen
  - `echo $HOME`: prints the contents of the variable __HOME__ i.e. your home directory to the screen
* `alias`: create a shortcut to another command or name to execute a long string.
  - `alias rm="/bin/rm -i"`

---  .class

## File Editing

* The two most commonly used editors on Linux/Unix systems are:
  -  vi or vim (vi improved)
  -  emacs
* vi/vim is installed by default on Linux/Unix systems and has only a command line interface (CLI).
* emacs has both a CLI and a graphical user interface (GUI).
* Other editors that you may come across on *nix systems
  - kate: default editor for KDE.
  - gedit: default text editor for GNOME desktop environment.
  - gvim: GUI version of vim
  - pico: console based plain text editor
  - nano: GNU.org clone of pico
  - kwrite: editor by KDE.

## Cluster Environment

* A cluster is a group of computers (nodes) that works together closely

*** =left width:30%

* Two types of nodes
   - Head/Login Node
   - Compute Node

* Multi-user environment

* Each user may have multiple jobs running simultaneously

*** =right width:65%

<img width = '640px' src = 'assets/img/solnetwork.png'>


--- .class #id

## How to run jobs

* All compute intensive jobs are scheduled
* Write a script to submit jobs to a scheduler
  - need to have some background in shell scripting (bash/tcsh)
* Need to specify
   - Resources required (which depends on configuration)
       - number of nodes
       - number of processes per node
       - memory per node
   - How long do you want the resources
       - have an estimate for how long your job will run
   - Which queue to submit jobs
       - SLURM uses the term _partition_ instead of _queue_


--- .class #id

## Scheduler &amp; Resource Management

* A software that manages resources (CPU time, memory, etc) and schedules job execution
   - Sol: Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management (SLURM)
   - Others:  Portable Batch System (PBS)
          - Scheduler: Maui
          - Resource Manager: Torque
          - Allocation Manager: Gold

* A job can be considered as a user’s request to use a certain amount of resources for a certain amount of time

* The Scheduler or queuing system determines
    - The order jobs are executed
    - On which node(s) jobs are executed



--- .class #id &twocol_width
 
## Job Scheduling

*** =left width:50%

* Map jobs onto the node-time space
    - Assuming CPU time is the only resource

* Need to find a balance between
    - Honoring the order in which jobs are received
    - Maximizing resource utilization

## Backfilling

*** =left width:50%
* A strategy to improve utilization
   - Allow a job to jump ahead of others when there are enough idle nodes
   - Must not affect the estimated start time of the job with the highest priority

*** =right width:45%

## SBATCH Filename Patterns

* sbatch allows for a filename pattern to contain one or more replacement
  symbols, which are a percent sign "%" followed by a letter (e.g. %j). 

| Pattern | Description |
|:-------:|:-----------:|
| %A |    Job array's master job allocation number. |
| %a |    Job array ID (index) number. |
| %J |    jobid.stepid of the running job. (e.g. "128.0") |
| %j |    jobid of the running job. |
| %N |    short hostname. This will create a separate IO file per node. |
| %n |    Node identifier relative to current job (e.g. "0" is the first node of the running job) This will create a separate IO file per node. |
| %s |    stepid of the running job. |
| %t |    task identifier (rank) relative to current job. This will create a separate IO file per task. |
| %u |    User name. |
| %x |    Job name. |

## Basic Job Manager Commands

* Submission
* Monitoring
* Manipulating
* Reporting

--- .class 

## Job Types

* Interactive Jobs
  - Set up an interactive environment on compute nodes for users
  - Will log you into a compute node and wait for your prompt
  - Purpose: testing and debugging code. __Do not run jobs on head node!!!__
      * All compute node have a naming convention __sol-[a,b,c]###__
      * head node is __sol__
* Batch Jobs
   - Executed using a batch script without user intervention
       - Advantage: system takes care of running the job
       - Disadvantage: cannot change sequence of commands after submission
   - Useful for Production runs
   - Workflow: write a script -> submit script -> take mini vacation ->
   analyze results

--- .class #id

## Job Types: Interactive

   - PBS: Use `qsub -I` command with PBS Directives
       *    `qsub -I -V -l walltime=<hh:mm:ss>,nodes=<# of nodes>:ppn=<# of core/node> -q <queue
   name>`

   - SLURM:  Use `srun` command with SBATCH Directives followed by `--pty /bin/bash`
       * `srun --time=<hh:mm:ss> --nodes=<# of nodes> --ntasks-per-node=<#
   of core/node> -p <queue name> --pty /bin/bash`
       * If you have `soltools` module loaded, then use `interact` with at
   least one SBATCH Directive
           - `interact -t 20` [Assumes `-p lts -n 1 -N 20`]
   - Run a job interactively replace `--pty /bin/bash --login` with the
     appropriate command. 
       - For e.g. `srun -t 20 -n 1 -p imlab --qos=nogpu $(which lammps) -in in.lj
     -var x 1 -var n 1`
       - Default values are 3 days, 1 node, 20 tasks per node and lts
   partition

## Job Types: Batch 

* Workflow: write a script -> submit script -> take mini vacation -> analyze
  results
* Submitting Batch Jobs
   * PBS: `qsub filename`
   * SLURM: `sbatch filename`

* `qsub` and `sbatch` can take the options for `#PBS` and `#SBATCH` as command line arguments
   * `qsub -l walltime=1:00:00,nodes=1:ppn=16 -q normal filename`
   * `sbatch --time=1:00:00 --nodes=1 --ntasks-per-node=20 -p lts filename`

## Monitoring &amp; Manipulating Jobs


| SLURM Command | Description | PBS Command |
|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-------------:|
| squeue | check job status (all jobs) | qstat |
| squeue -u username | check job status of user <em>username</em> | qstat -u username |

## Need to run multiple jobs in sequence?

* Option 1: Submit jobs as soon as previous jobs complete
* Option 2: Submit jobs with a dependency
    * [SLURM](https://webapps.lehigh.edu/dokuwiki/sites/researchcomputing/doku.php?id=slurm#submitting_dependency_jobs):
  `sbatch --dependency=afterok:<JobID> <Submit Script>`
    * [PBS](https://webapps.lehigh.edu/dokuwiki/sites/researchcomputing/doku.php?id=corona#submitting_dependency_jobs):
  `qsub -W depend=afterok:<JobID> <Submit Script>`

* You want to run several serial processor jobs on
    * one node: your submit script should be able to run several serial
    jobs in background and then use the `wait` command for all jobs to finish
    * more than one node: this requires some background in scripting but the
    idea is the same as above
