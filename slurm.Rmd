* Modify your .bashrc/.tcshrc to add software to your path, OR
* create a module and dynamically load it so that it doesn't interfere 
 with other software installed on the system
  - e.g. You might want to use openmpi instead of mvapich2 
  - the system admin may not want install it system wide for just one user
* Add the directory where you will install the module files to the variable 
  MODULEPATH in .bashrc/.tcshrc

## Cluster Environment

* A cluster is a group of computers (nodes) that works together closely

*** =left width:30%

* Two types of nodes
   - Head/Login Node
   - Compute Node

* Multi-user environment

* Each user may have multiple jobs running simultaneously

*** =right width:65%

<img width = '640px' src = 'assets/img/solnetwork.png'>


--- .class #id

## How to run jobs

* All compute intensive jobs are batch scheduled
* Write a script to submit jobs to a scheduler
  - need to have some background in shell scripting (bash/tcsh)
* Need to specify
   - Resources required (which depends on configuration)
       - number of nodes
       - number of processes per node
       - memory per node
   - How long do you want the resources
       - have an estimate for how long your job will run
   - Which queue to submit jobs


--- .class #id

## Batch Queuing System

* A software that manages resources (CPU time, memory, etc) and schedules job execution
   - Sol: Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management (SLURM)
   - Others:  Portable Batch System (PBS)
          - Scheduler: Maui
          - Resource Manager: Torque
          - Allocation Manager: Gold

* A job can be considered as a user’s request to use a certain amount of resources for a certain amount of time

* The batch queuing system determines
    - The order jobs are executed
    - On which node(s) jobs are executed



--- .class #id &twocol_width
 
## Job Scheduling

*** =left width:50%

* Map jobs onto the node-time space
    - Assuming CPU time is the only resource

* Need to find a balance between
    - Honoring the order in which jobs are received
    - Maximizing resource utilization


*** =right width:45%

<img width = '440px' src = 'assets/img/JobSchedule-1.png'>


--- .class #id &twocol_width
 
## Backfilling

*** =left width:50%
* A strategy to improve utilization
   - Allow a job to jump ahead of others when there are enough idle nodes
   - Must not affect the estimated start time of the job with the highest priority

*** =right width:45%

<img width = '440px' src = 'assets/img/JobSchedule-2.png'>



--- .class #id &twocol_width
 
## How much time must I request

* Ask for an amount of time that is
    - Long enough for your job to complete
    - As short as possible to increase the chance of backfilling

| Queue Name | Max Runtime in hours | Max Simultaneous Core-hours |
|:----------:|:-----------:|:---------------------------:|
| smp-test | 1 | 4 |
| smp | 96 | 384 |


--- .class #id

## How much memory can I use?

* The amount of installed memory less the amount that is used by the operating system and other utilities

* A general rule of thumb on most HPC resources: leave 1-2GB for the OS to run. 

* Sol

| Partition | Max Memory/core (GB) | Recommended Memory/Core (GB) |
|:---------:|:--------------------:|:----------------------------:|
| lts | 6.4 | 6.2 |
| eng/imlab/imlab-gpu | 5.3 | 5.1 |
| engc | 2.66 | 2.4 |


*  <span class="alert">if you need to run a single core job that requires 10GB memory in the imlab partition, you need to request 2 cores even though you are only using
         1 core.</span>  

* Maia: Users need to specify memory required in their submit script. Max
memory that should be requested is 126GB.

## Basic Job Manager Commands

* Submission
* Monitoring
* Manipulating
* Reporting

--- .class #id

## Job Types: Interactive

   - Set up an interactive environment on compute nodes for users
   - Purpose: testing and debugging code. __Do not run jobs on head node!!!__

   - PBS: `qsub -I -V -l walltime=<hh:mm:ss>,nodes=<# of nodes>:ppn=<# of core/node> -q <queue
   name>`

   - SLURM: `srun --time=<hh:mm:ss> --nodes=<# of nodes> --ntasks-per-node=<#
   of core/node> -p <queue name> --pty /bin/bash --login`
   - Run a job interactively replace `--pty /bin/bash --login` with the
     appropriate command. 
       - For e.g. `srun -t 20 -n 1 -p imlab --qos=nogpu $(which lammps) -in in.lj
     -var x 1 -var n 1`
       - Default values are 3 days, 1 node, 20 tasks per node and lts
   partition

--- .class #id

## Job Types: Batch 

   - Executed using a batch script without user intervention
       - Advantage: system takes care of running the job
       - Disadvantage: cannot change sequence of commands after submission
   - Useful for Production runs

## Usage Reporting

* [sacct](http://slurm.schedmd.com/sacct.html): displays accounting data for all jobs and job steps in the SLURM job accounting log or Slurm database
* [sshare](http://slurm.schedmd.com/sshare.html): Tool for listing the shares of associations to a cluster. 

* We have created scripts based on these to provide usage reporting
    -  `alloc_summary.sh`
        - included in your .bash_profile
        - prints allocation usage on your login shell
    -  `balance`
        - prints allocation usage summary
    -  `solreport`
        - obtain your monthly usage report
        - PIs can obtain usage report for all or specific users on their
	allocation
        - use `--help` for usage information

## Need to run multiple jobs in sequence?

* Option 1: Submit jobs as soon as previous jobs complete
* Option 2: Submit jobs with a dependency
    * [SLURM](https://webapps.lehigh.edu/dokuwiki/sites/researchcomputing/doku.php?id=slurm#submitting_dependency_jobs):
  `sbatch --dependency=afterok:<JobID> <Submit Script>`
    * [PBS](https://webapps.lehigh.edu/dokuwiki/sites/researchcomputing/doku.php?id=corona#submitting_dependency_jobs):
  `qsub -W depend=afterok:<JobID> <Submit Script>`

* You want to run several serial processor jobs on
    * one node: your submit script should be able to run several serial
    jobs in background and then use the `wait` command for all jobs to finish
    * more than one node: this requires some background in scripting but the
    idea is the same as above
