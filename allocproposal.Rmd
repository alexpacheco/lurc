# Director's Discretionary Fund

- The Director's Discretionary Fund enables distributing compute and storage with minimal oversight from the Allocation Committee.
- Total of 800K SUs and 40TB of storage when combined with StartUp storage quota
- Use Cases
  - Each PI receives a 1TB storage quota that is shared among all his/her sponsored users.
  - 200GB per active user is recommended, larger groups can requst additional space.
    - PIs who unneccessarily add inactive users to get a larger storage will have their storage reduced to default 1TB.
    - Such PIs will have their storage request reviewed and approved by allocation committee.
  - Trial Allocations: short term allocations designed for new users.
  - Education Allocations: for courses, workshops and other EOT purposes.




---

# Trial Allocations

  - Why?
    - There are research groups that may benefit from HPC resources.
    - Using HPC resources have a steep learning curve, this allows group to investigate if HPC resources fit their needs before committing to larger scale usage of HPC resources. 
  - Trial Allocations have a maximum of 10K SUs per PI and a 6 month duration.
  - Total Available: 300K SUs, 20TB.
  - Requirement: Short abstract describing proposed work.
  - Optional: What is your eventual goal?
    - <em>This is both short-term computing for completing a project and also a trial to determine how well the resources will meet our future needs.</em>
    - <em>The purpose of this proposal is for my laboratory to evaluate use of HPC resources at Lehigh for the more computationally intensive steps of the workflow, highlighted in the figure below.</em>
  - Progress report will be required for subsequent allocation request.
  - Apply anytime at https://go.lehigh.edu/hpcalloctrial


---

# Education Allocations
  - Developing the next generation workforce is a cornerstone of NSF campus research cyberinfrastructure grants.
  - Use of Hawk for education - course work and workshops, is strongly encouraged.
  - __Courses__: A minimum of 500 SU/student is recommended. 
     - 50K SU max and 1TB Ceph space per course.
     - __Capstone projects__: are considered to be a single course and are eligible for only one allocation.
         - For additional allocations, please request a startup or research allocation
     - Duration: 2 weeks past the end of the semester.
  - __Workshops/Summer Programs__: Faculty, Departments, Institutes or Colleges will be eligible for allocations (max 10K) to support workshops and summer programs centered on scientific computing.
     - Duration: Length of the workshop or 2 weeks.
  - Total Available: 500K SUs
  - Apply at https://go.lehigh.edu/hpcallocedu
  - HPC staff can deliver instruction on using the resources. We prefer educating users rather than simplifying things to obscure how a HPC resource works. 

---

# StartUp Allocations

- Startup Allocations are small allocation requests (<25K) with a 1 year duration. 
- A faculty can be a PI or collaborator on only two active Startup Allocation at any time.
- __Requirements__: Short abstract (min 500 words, 1 page max) with the description of the work and the amount of computing time requested.
- __Amount Requested__: Include a justification for the amount requested (required for renewals)
  - <em>On the redacted cluster 30 grids took up to an average of 4 hours of wall clock time. For 63,676 grids, this would equate to 8,490 SUs. Given 6 experiments, this would total 50940 SU. With full AVX512 instructions enabled, Hawk should be twice as fast as redacted cluster, so that would total 25,470 SUs.  Therefore I am requesting 25K SUs as part of a StartUp allocation.</em>
- Reviewed (last week) & approved (first week of next month) monthly. 
- Renewal requires progress report, publication list, grants/ awards and list of graduated students if any.
- Apply anytime at https://go.lehigh.edu/hpcallocstartup
- For Renewals: we strongly recommend a research allocation.

---

# Research and Storage Allocations

- For requests upto 300K SUs and/or storage up to 5TB.
- Max allocation is 300K and 5TB per PI at any given time.
- Requires a detailed proposal similar to XSEDE. Should contain
  - Abstract, Description of the project and how resources will be used.
  - Justify requested allocations based on benchmarks results.
  - Report of prior work done.
  - List of publications, presentations, awards and students graduated.
- Non HPC PIs requesting storage allocations should also describe:
  - why other forms of storage are not suitable and any plans to backup data stored, and
  - plans to  move/save the data if project is not renewed/approved next year.  
- Reviewed and Approved semi annually by allocation committee.
  - Allocations to begin on Jan 1 and Jul 1 and last a year.
  - Call for proposals will be issued in May and Nov to the HPC mailing list.
  - Submission deadline: June 15 and Dec 15

# General Proposal Outline

.center2[
* Research Objectives
* Computational methodology (Applications/Codes)
* Application efficiencies
* Computational Research Plan
* Justification for SUs and/or TB requested
]

---

# Research Objectives

* Describe the research activities to be pursued
* Keep it short. 
   * Provide enough details to support the method and computational plan being proposed.
   * Members of the review committee are not experts in your field.
   * The review committee expects you to relate how your research plan meets your computational needs.
   * We will not reject your initial proposal if you cannot make this estimation.
   * BUT we expect you to make an attempt to understand how to make this estimation and provide this information in your renewal proposal.

* The review committee is not judging your research. 
* We want to educate you on how to estimate your computational needs based on the research you are doing and the resources that you plan to use.


---

# Computational Methods (Application and Codes)

* Compute Requests
  * Describe the Applications and Codes you plan to use.
  * Describe the methods/algorithms employed in your research.
  * Home grown codes: describe the code development and features, describe your plan to advance the code i.e. parallelize the code for better scaling. 
  * How do the applications or codes scale with number of cpus or gpus.
  * Provide performance and scaling details.
     * Renewals: you should provide performance and scaling data from past jobs.
* Storage Requests
  * Describe the data to be stored.
  * Describe the amount and expected growth of data to be stored
  * If this is data generated from computational, what % is transient data that can discared after a job is complete/analyzed.
  * Our resources are not backed up. Describe how you plan to backup the data.


---

# Computational Research Plan

* Explicitly describe the problem cases
* __Examples__:
   * This requires estimating phylogenetic trees, representing evolutionary relationships among 200 - 400 mammalian species, from ~20,000 coding sequence alignments; applying custom software to use these trees to test for association between branch length and dietary phenotype; and using at least 500,000 phylogenetic simulations per phenotype analyzed to assess empirical significance.
   * In the benchmark simulation of dynamic crack branching in soda-lime glass, a meshfree peridynamics numerical solver in C++ was employed. The mesh has around _O(10<sup>5</sup>)_ material points (_O(10<sup>6</sup>)_ degrees of freedom) and needs _O(10<sup>5</sup>)_ time steps/iterations to capture the whole crack propagation procedure. Each simulation required around 100 CPU hours, and at least 200 simulations
   * Our computational experiments begin with DFT optimization of our molecules to determine their ground state (GS) electronic structure. We will then perform single excitations via TDDFT to correlate experimentally observed absorption features with calculated electronic transitions.
   

---

# Justification of Resources

* Summarize your requirements based on contents of previous two sections
* __Example 1__: Trial
    * we need to run DFT simulations coupled with ML models to discover regions of negative curvature that ...
* __Example 2__: StartUp 
    * Assuming we have a database with 300 subjects, for each subject preprocessing, 300 cores would be used for 3 hours. Thus, to process several databases and to calculate multiple statistic results, at least 25k SUs are needed.
