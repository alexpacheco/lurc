## Module Command

| Command | Description |
|:-------:|:-----------:|
| <code>module avail</code> | show list of software available on resource |
| <code>module load abc</code> | add software <code>abc</code> to your environment (modify your <code>PATH</code>, <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> etc as needed) |
| <code>module unload abc</code> | remove <code>abc</code> from your environment |
| <code>module swap abc1 abc2</code> | swap <code>abc1</code> with <code>abc2</code> in your environment |
| <code>module purge</code> | remove all modules from your environment |
| <code>module show abc</code> | display what variables are added or modified in your environment |
| <code>module help abc</code> | display help message for the module <code>abc</code> |

* Users who prefer not to use the module environment will need to modify their
  .bashrc or .tcshrc files. Run `module show` for list variables that need
  modified, appended or prepended

--- .class #id

## Creating your own modules

* You can always install a software in your home directory
* Stay compliant with software licensing
* Modify your .bashrc/.tcshrc to add software to your path, OR
* create a module and dynamically load it so that it doesn't interfere 
 with other software installed on the system
  - e.g. You might want a different version of openmpi installed 
  - the system admin may not want install it system wide for just one user
* Add the directory where you will install the module files to the variable 
  MODULEPATH in .bashrc/.tcshrc
```{sh eval=FALSE}
# My .bashrc file
export MODULEPATH=${MODULEPATH}:/home/alp514/modulefiles
```

--- .class

## Module File Example

<img width = '900px' src = 'assets/img/mcr.png'>


--- .class

## Compilers

* Various versions of compilers installed on Sol 
* Open Source: GNU Compiler (also called gcc even though gcc is the c compiler)
   - 4.8.5 (system default), 5.3.0, 6.1.0 and 7.1.0
* Commercial: Only two seats of each
   - Intel Compiler: 16.0.3, 17.0.0 and 17.0.3
   - Portland Group or PGI: 16.5, 16.10, 17.4 and 17.7
* _We are licensed to install any available version_
* On Sol, all except gcc 4.8.5 are available via the module environment

| Language | GNU | Intel | PGI |
|:--------:|:---:|:-----:|:---:|
| Fortran  | gfortran | ifort | pgf77/pgf90 |
| C | gcc | icc | pgcc |
| C++ | g++ | icpc | pgCC |


--- .class

## Compiling Code

* Usage: `<compiler> <options> <source code>`
* Example:
  - `ifort -o saxpyf saxpy.f90`
  - `gcc -o saxpyc saxpy.c`
* Common Compiler options or flags
  - `-o myexec`: compile code and create an executable myexec. If this option is not given, then a default `a.out` is created.
  - `-l{libname}`: link compiled code to a library called libname. e.g. to use lapack libraries, add `-llapack` as a compiler flag.
  - `-L{directory path}`: directory to search for libraries. e.g. `-L/usr/lib64 -llapack` will search for lapack libraries in /usr/lib64.
  - `-I{directory path}`: directory to search for include files and fortran modules.


--- .class

## Compilers for Parallel Programming: OpenMP & TBB

* OpenMP support is built-in

| Compiler | OpenMP Flag |
|:---:|:---:|
| GNU | -fopenmp |
| Intel | -qopenmp |
| PGI | -openmp |

* TBB is available as part of Intel Compiler suite
   - `-L$TBBROOT/lib/intel64_lin/gcc4.4 -ltbb` where `$TBBROOT` depends on the Intel Compiler Suite you want to use.
       - use `module show intel/<version>` to get value of `$TBBROOT`
       - Not sure if this will work for PGI Compilers


--- .class

## Compilers for Parallel Programming: MPI

* MPI is a library and not a compiler, built or compiled for different compilers.

| Language | Compile Command |
|:--------:|:---:|
| Fortran  | mpif90 |
| C | mpicc |
| C++ | mpicxx |

* The MPI compiler command is just a wrapper around the underlying compiler
```{bash eval=FALSE}
[alp514.sol](1080): mpif90 -show
ifort -fPIC -I/share/Apps/mvapich2/2.1/intel-16.0.3/include -I/share/Apps/mvapich2/2.1/intel-16.0.3/include 
  -L/share/Apps/mvapich2/2.1/intel-16.0.3/lib -lmpifort -Wl,-rpath -Wl,/share/Apps/mvapich2/2.1/intel-16.0.3/lib 
  -Wl,--enable-new-dtags -lmpi
```
* Usage: `<compiler> <options> <source code>`
* Example:
   - `mpif90 -o laplace_f90 laplace_mpi.f90`
   - `mpicc -o laplace_c laplace_mpi.c`


--- .class

## MPI Libraries

* There are two different MPI implementations commonly used
* `MPICH`: Developed by Argonned National Laboratory
   - used as a starting point for various commercial and open source MPI libraries
   - `MVAPICH2`: Developed by D. K. Panda with support for  InfiniBand, iWARP, RoCE, and Intel Omni-Path. (default MPI on Sol)
   - `Intel MPI`: Intel's version of MPI. __You need this for Xeon Phi MICs__.
      - available in cluster edition of Intel Compiler Suite. Not available at Lehigh
   - `IBM MPI` for IBM BlueGene and `CRAY MPI` for Cray systems
* `OpenMPI`: A Free, Open Source implementation from merger of three well know MPI implementations. Can be used for commodity network as well as high speed network
   - `FT-MPI` from the University of Tennessee
   - `LA-MPI` from Los Alamos National Laboratory
   - `LAM/MPI` from Indiana University

  
--- ,class

## Running MPI Programs

* Every MPI implementation come with their own job launcher: `mpiexec`, `mpirun` (OpenMPI)  or `mpirun_rsh` (MVAPICH2)
* Example:
   - `mpiexec [options] <program name> [program options]`
* Required options: number of processes and list of hosts on which to run program 

| Option Description | mpiexec | mpirun | mpirun_rsh |
|:-----------:|:-------:|:------:|:----------:|
| run on `x` cores | -n x | -n x | -n x |
|                  | -np x | -np x | |
| location of the hostfile | -f filename | -machinefile filename | -hostfile filename |
| list of hosts | --host <host1,host2,...,hostN> | --host <host1,host2,...,hostN> | |

* To run a MPI code, you need to use the launcher from the same implementation that was used to compile the code.
* For e.g.: You cannot compile code with OpenMPI and run using the MPICH and MVAPICH2's launcher
   - Since MVAPICH2 is based on MPICH, you can launch MVAPICH2 compiled code using MPICH's launcher.


--- .class

## Compiling Using Makefiles

* Makefile is a file containing a set of directives used with the make build automation tool.
   - directs make on how to compile and link a program.
* Using C/C++ as an example, when a C/C++ source file is changed, it must be recompiled. 
* If a header file has changed, each C/C++ source file that includes the header file must be recompiled to be safe. 
* Each compilation produces an object file corresponding to the source file. 
* Finally, if any source file has been recompiled, all the object files, whether newly made or saved from previous compilations, must be linked together to produce the new executable program.
* These instructions with their dependencies are specified in a makefile. 
* If none of the files that are prerequisites have been changed since the last time the program was compiled, no actions take place. 
* For large software projects, using Makefiles can substantially reduce build times if only a few source files have changed.

* Write a script to submit jobs to a scheduler
  - need to have some background in shell scripting (bash/tcsh)
* Need to specify
   - Resources required (which depends on configuration)
       - number of nodes
       - number of processes per node
       - memory per node
   - How long do you want the resources
       - have an estimate for how long your job will run
   - Which queue to submit jobs
       - SLURM uses the term _partition_ instead of _queue_

## Scheduler &amp; Resource Management

* A software that manages resources (CPU time, memory, etc) and schedules job execution
   - Sol: Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management (SLURM)
   - Others:  Portable Batch System (PBS)
          - Scheduler: Maui
          - Resource Manager: Torque
          - Allocation Manager: Gold

* A job can be considered as a user’s request to use a certain amount of resources for a certain amount of time

* The Scheduler or queuing system determines
    - The order jobs are executed
    - On which node(s) jobs are executed



--- .class #id &twocol_width
 
## Job Scheduling

*** =left width:50%

* Map jobs onto the node-time space
    - Assuming CPU time is the only resource

* Need to find a balance between
    - Honoring the order in which jobs are received
    - Maximizing resource utilization


*** =right width:45%

<img width = '440px' src = 'assets/img/JobSchedule-1.png'>


--- .class #id &twocol_width
 
## Backfilling

*** =left width:50%
* A strategy to improve utilization
   - Allow a job to jump ahead of others when there are enough idle nodes
   - Must not affect the estimated start time of the job with the highest priority

*** =right width:45%

<img width = '440px' src = 'assets/img/JobSchedule-2.png'>



--- .class #id &twocol_width
 
## How much time must I request

* Ask for an amount of time that is
    - Long enough for your job to complete
    - As short as possible to increase the chance of backfilling

*** =left width:45%

<img width = '360px' src = 'assets/img/JobSchedule-3.png'>

## Available Queues

| Cluster | Partition Name | Max Runtime in hours | Max SU consumed node per hour |
|:-------:|:----------:|:--------------------:|:--------------------:|
| Sol | _lts_ | 72 | 20 (will change to 18+2)|
| | imlab | 48 | 22 | 
| | imlab-gpu | 48 | 24 |
| | _eng_ | 72 | 24 (will change to 22+2)|
| | _engc_ | 72 | 24 (will change to 22+2)|
| | all-cpu | 48 |
| | all-gpu | 48 |

* Maia

| Queue Name | Max Runtime in hours | Max Simultaneous Core-hours |
|:----------:|:-----------:|:---------------------------:|
| smp-test | 1 | 4 |
| smp | 96 | 384 |

--- .class #id

## How much memory can or should I use per core?

* The amount of installed memory less the amount that is used by the operating system and other utilities

* A general rule of thumb on most HPC resources: leave 1-2GB for the OS to run. 

| Cluster | Partition | Max Memory/core (GB) | Recommended Memory/Core (GB) |
|:-------:|:---------:|:--------------------:|:----------------------------:|
| Sol | lts | 6.4 | 6.2 |
|     | eng/imlab/imlab-gpu | 5.3 | 5.1 |
|     | engc | 2.66 | 2.4 |

*  <span class="alert">if you need to run a single core job that requires 10GB memory in the imlab partition, you need to request 2 cores even though you are only using
         1 core.</span>  

* Maia: Users need to specify memory required in their submit script. Max
memory that should be requested is 126GB.

## SBATCH Filename Patterns

* sbatch allows for a filename pattern to contain one or more replacement
  symbols, which are a percent sign "%" followed by a letter (e.g. %j). 

| Pattern | Description |
|:-------:|:-----------:|
| %A |    Job array's master job allocation number. |
| %a |    Job array ID (index) number. |
| %J |    jobid.stepid of the running job. (e.g. "128.0") |
| %j |    jobid of the running job. |
| %N |    short hostname. This will create a separate IO file per node. |
| %n |    Node identifier relative to current job (e.g. "0" is the first node of the running job) This will create a separate IO file per node. |
| %s |    stepid of the running job. |
| %t |    task identifier (rank) relative to current job. This will create a separate IO file per task. |
| %u |    User name. |
| %x |    Job name. |

## Basic Job Manager Commands

* Submission
* Monitoring
* Manipulating
* Reporting

--- .class 

## Job Types

* Interactive Jobs
  - Set up an interactive environment on compute nodes for users
  - Will log you into a compute node and wait for your prompt
  - Purpose: testing and debugging code. __Do not run jobs on head node!!!__
      * All compute node have a naming convention __sol-[a,b,c]###__
      * head node is __sol__
* Batch Jobs
   - Executed using a batch script without user intervention
       - Advantage: system takes care of running the job
       - Disadvantage: cannot change sequence of commands after submission
   - Useful for Production runs
   - Workflow: write a script -> submit script -> take mini vacation ->
   analyze results

--- .class #id

## Job Types: Interactive

   - PBS: Use `qsub -I` command with PBS Directives
       *    `qsub -I -V -l walltime=<hh:mm:ss>,nodes=<# of nodes>:ppn=<# of core/node> -q <queue
   name>`

   - SLURM:  Use `srun` command with SBATCH Directives followed by `--pty /bin/bash`
       * `srun --time=<hh:mm:ss> --nodes=<# of nodes> --ntasks-per-node=<#
   of core/node> -p <queue name> --pty /bin/bash`
       * If you have `soltools` module loaded, then use `interact` with at
   least one SBATCH Directive
           - `interact -t 20` [Assumes `-p lts -n 1 -N 20`]
   - Run a job interactively replace `--pty /bin/bash --login` with the
     appropriate command. 
       - For e.g. `srun -t 20 -n 1 -p imlab --qos=nogpu $(which lammps) -in in.lj
     -var x 1 -var n 1`
       - Default values are 3 days, 1 node, 20 tasks per node and lts
   partition

--- .class #id

## Job Types: Batch 

* Workflow: write a script -> submit script -> take mini vacation -> analyze
  results
* Submitting Batch Jobs
   * PBS: `qsub filename`
   * SLURM: `sbatch filename`

* `qsub` and `sbatch` can take the options for `#PBS` and `#SBATCH` as command line arguments
   * `qsub -l walltime=1:00:00,nodes=1:ppn=16 -q normal filename`
   * `sbatch --time=1:00:00 --nodes=1 --ntasks-per-node=20 -p lts filename`

## Monitoring &amp; Manipulating Jobs


| SLURM Command | Description | PBS Command |
|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-------------:|
| squeue | check job status (all jobs) | qstat |
| squeue -u username | check job status of user <em>username</em> | qstat -u username |
| squeue --start | Show <strong>estimated</strong> start time of jobs in queue | showstart jobid |
| scontrol show job jobid | Check status of your job identified by <em>jobid</em> | checkjob jobid |
| scancel jobid | Cancel your job identified by <em>jobid</em> | qdel jobid |
| scontrol hold jobid | Put your job identified by <em>jobid</em> on hold | qhold jobid |
| scontrol release jobid | Release the hold that <strong>you put</strong> on <em>jobid | qrls jobid |

* The following scripts written by RC staff can also be used for monitoring jobs.
   * __checkq__: `squeue` with additional useful option. 
   * __checkload__: `sinfo` with additional options to show load on compute nodes.  
* load the `soltools` module to get access to RC staff created scripts

--- .class #id

## Usage Reporting

* [sacct](http://slurm.schedmd.com/sacct.html): displays accounting data for all jobs and job steps in the SLURM job accounting log or Slurm database
* [sshare](http://slurm.schedmd.com/sshare.html): Tool for listing the shares of associations to a cluster. 

* We have created scripts based on these to provide usage reporting
    -  `alloc_summary.sh`
        - included in your .bash_profile
        - prints allocation usage on your login shell
    -  `balance`
        - prints allocation usage summary
    -  `solreport`
        - obtain your monthly usage report
        - PIs can obtain usage report for all or specific users on their
	allocation
        - use `--help` for usage information

--- .class #id

## Need to run multiple jobs in sequence?

* Option 1: Submit jobs as soon as previous jobs complete
* Option 2: Submit jobs with a dependency
    * [SLURM](https://webapps.lehigh.edu/dokuwiki/sites/researchcomputing/doku.php?id=slurm#submitting_dependency_jobs):
  `sbatch --dependency=afterok:<JobID> <Submit Script>`
    * [PBS](https://webapps.lehigh.edu/dokuwiki/sites/researchcomputing/doku.php?id=corona#submitting_dependency_jobs):
  `qsub -W depend=afterok:<JobID> <Submit Script>`

* You want to run several serial processor jobs on
    * one node: your submit script should be able to run several serial
    jobs in background and then use the `wait` command for all jobs to finish
    * more than one node: this requires some background in scripting but the
    idea is the same as above
