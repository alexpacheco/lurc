## Allocation Charges 

* Cost per core-hour or service unit (SU) is 1&cent;
* SU is defined as 1 hour of computing on 1 core of the Sol base compute node.
   - One base compute node of Sol consumes 20 SU/hour, 480 SU/day and 175,200 SU/year

* PIs can share allocations with their collaborators
   - Minimum Annual Purchase of 50,000 SU - &#36;500/year
   - Additional Increments of 10,000 SU - &#36;100 per 10K increments
   - Fixed Allocation cycle: Oct 1 - Sep 30
   - Unused allocations do not rollover to next allocation cycle
   - Total available computing time for purchase annually: 1.4M SUs or 1 year of continous computing on 8 nodes

--- .class

## Condo Investments

* New sustainable model for High Performance Computing at Lehigh
* Faculty (Condo Investor) purchase compute nodes from grants to increase overall capacity of Sol
* LTS will provide for four years or length of hardware warranty purchased.
   - System Administration, Power and Cooling, User Support for Condo Investments
* Condo Investor
   - receives annual allocation equivalent to their investment for the length of
     investment
   - can utilize allocations on all available nodes, including nodes from other Condo Investors
   - allows idle cycles on investment to be used by other Sol users
   - unused allocation will not rollover to the next allocation cycle.
   - can purchase additional SUs in 10K increments (minimum 50K not required)
       -  and must be consumed in current allocation cycle
* Annual Allocation cycle is Oct. 1 - Sep. 30.

## Storage resources

* LTS provides various storage options for research and teaching..
* Some are cloud based and subject to Lehigh's Cloud Policy
* For research, LTS provides a 1PB storage system called Ceph
* Ceph is based on the Ceph software
* Research groups can purchase a sharable project space on Ceph @ &#36;200/TB/year
* Ceph is in-house, built, operated and administered by LTS Research Computing Staff.
  - located in Data Center in EWFM with a backup cluster in Packard Lab
* HPC users can write job output directly to their Ceph volume
* Ceph volume can be mounted as a network drive on Windows or CIFS on Mac and Linux
  - [See Ceph FAQ] (http://lts.lehigh.edu/services/faq/ceph-faq) for more details
* Storage quota on
  - Maia: 5GB
  - Sol: 150GB

## Data Transfer, ScienceDMZ and Globus

* NSF funded Science DMZ to improve campus connectivity to the national research cyberinfrastructure.
* Upto 50TB storage is available on the Data Transfer Node (DTN) on ScienceDMZ.
  * Storage space is only for data transfer. Once transfer is complete, storage needs to be deleted from DTN
* Access to DTN with shell access provided on request
* [Globus](https://www.globus.org) is the preferred method to transfer data to and from NSF and DOE supercomputing centers.
  * hosted service that manages the entire operation, monitoring performance and errors, retrying failed transfers, correcting problems automatically whenever possible, and reporting status to keep you informed while you focus on your research.
  * [How to Use Globus at Lehigh?](https://researchcomputing.lehigh.edu/help/globus)
  * No special access required on DTN to transfer data via Globus

## Available Software

* Commercial, Free and Open source software is installed on
  - [Maia](https://webapps.lehigh.edu/dokuwiki/sites/researchcomputing/doku.php?id=maia#installed_software): /zhome/Apps
  - [Sol](https://webapps.lehigh.edu/dokuwiki/sites/researchcomputing/doku.php?id=sol#installed_software): /share/Apps
* Software is managed using module environment
  - Why? We may have different versions of same software or software built with different compilers
  - Module environment allows you to dynamically change your &#42;nix environment based on software being used
  - Standard on many University and national High Performance Computing resource since circa 2011
* How to use Sol/Maia Software on your [linux](https://webapps.lehigh.edu/dokuwiki/sites/researchcomputing/doku.php?id=linux) workstation
* LTS provides [licensed and open source software](https://software.lehigh.edu) for Windows, Mac and Linux and [Gogs](https://gogs.cc.lehigh.eu), a self hosted Git Service or Github clone
