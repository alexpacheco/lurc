## Accessing Research Computing Resources

* All Research Computing resources are accessible using ssh while on Lehigh's network
* Corona: `ssh username@corona.cc.lehigh.edu`
* Capella: `ssh username@capella.cc.lehigh.edu`
* Cuda0: `ssh username@cuda0.cc.lehigh.edu`
* Trits{1,2,3}: `ssh username@trits{1,2,3}.cc.lehigh.edu`
* Maia: No direct access to Maia, instead login to the polaris
* Polaris: `ssh username@polaris.cc.lehigh.edu`
  - Polaris is a gateway that also hosts the batch scheduler for Maia.
  - No computing software including compilers is available on Polaris.
  - Login to Maia to request computing time on Maia including interactive access to Maia.
* If you are not Lehigh's network, login to the ssh gateway to get Research Computing resources.
  - `ssh username@ssh.cc.lehigh.edu`

## What about Storage resources

* LTS provides various storage options.
* Some of these are in the cloud and subject to Lehigh's Cloud Policy
* For research, LTS provides a 1PB storage system called Ceph
* Ceph is based on the Ceph software
* Research groups can purchase a project space on Ceph @ $200/TB/year that can be shared
* Ceph is in-house, built, operated and administered by LTS Research Computing Staff.
  - located in Data Center in EWFM with a backup cluster in Packard Lab
* HPC users can write job output directly to their Ceph volume
* Ceph volume can be mounted as a network drive on Windows or CIFS on Mac and Linux
  - [See Ceph FAQ] (http://lts.lehigh.edu/services/faq/ceph-faq) for more details
* HPC User home directory quota
  - Maia: 5GB
  - Other Clusters: 150GB shared between Corona, Capella, Cuda and Trits

## Software available on HPC systems

* Most software is installed in /zhome/Apps
  - may also be accessible from some workstations on campus
  - some software are installed locally. For e.g. CUDA compilers are local to Cuda0
* Software is managed using module environment
  - Why? We may have different versions of same software or software built with different compilers
  - Module environment allows you to dynamically change your *nix environment based on software being used
  - Standard on many University and national High Performance Computing resource since circa 2011

## Software on Corona

## How does module work?

* If you have access to HPC resources, try some of these commands
* `module avail`: show list of software available on resource
* `module load abc`: add software `abc` to your environment (modify your `PATH`, `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` etc as needed)
* `module unload abc`: remove `abc` from your envionment
* `module swap abc1 abc2`: swap `abc1` with `abc2` in your environment
* `module purge`: remove all modules from your environment
* `module show abc`: display what variables are added or modified in your environment

* Modify your .bashrc/.tcshrc to add software to your path, OR
* create a module and dynamically load it so that it doesn't interfere 
 with other software installed on the system
  - e.g. You might want a different version of openmpi installed 
  - the system admin may not want install it system wide for just one user
* Add the directory where you will install the module files to the variable 
  MODULEPATH in .bashrc/.tcshrc
```{sh eval=FALSE}
# My .bashrc file
export MODULEPATH=${MODULEPATH}:/zhome/alp514/modulefiles
```

## XSEDE

* The E<b>x</b>treme <b>S</b>cience and <b>E</b>ngineering <b>D</b>iscovery <b>E</b>nvironment (<strong>XSEDE</strong>) is the most advanced, powerful, and robust collection of integrated advanced digital resources and services in the world. 

* It is a single virtual system that scientists can use to interactively share computing resources, data, and expertise.

* Scientists and engineers around the world use these resources and services—things like supercomputers, collections of data, and new tools—to make our lives healthier, safer, and better. 

* XSEDE, and the experts who lead the program, will make these resources easier to use and help more people use them.


*** =left width:60%
* The five-year, $121-million project is supported by the National Science Foundation. 

* It replaces and expands on the NSF TeraGrid project.

## How do I get started on XSEDE?

* Apply for an account at the [XSEDE Portal](https://portal.xsede.org).
* There is no charge to get an XSEDE portal account.  
* You need a portal account to register for XSEDE Tutorials and Workshops
* To use XSEDE's compute and data resources, you need to have an allocation.
* An allocation on a particular resource activates your account on that allocation.
* Researchers and Educators from US universities and federal research labs can 
serve as Principle Investigators on XSEDE allocation.
* A PI can add students to his/her allocations.
* XSEDE also has a Campus Champion Program
* A XSEDE Campus Champion is a local source of knowledge about high-performance 
and high-throughput computing and other digital services, opportunities and resources. 
* A Campus Champion can request start up allocations on all XSEDE resources to help 
 local users with getting started on XSEDE resources.
