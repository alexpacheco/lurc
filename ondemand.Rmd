# Accessing Sol

* Sol: accessible using ssh while on Lehigh&#39;s network.
 ```{bash eval=F}
 ssh username@sol.cc.lehigh.edu
  ```
   * Windows PC require a SSH client such as [MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/) or [Putty](https://putty.org/).
   * Mac and Linux PC&#39;s, ssh is built in to the terminal application. 
* Login to the ssh gateway to get on Lehigh&#39;s network or connect to VPN first 
 ```{bash eval=F}
 ssh username@ssh.cc.lehigh.edu
 ``` 
 and then login to Sol using the above ssh command.
  *  Alternatively, use the following command while off campus.
  ```{bash eval=F}
  ssh -J username@ssh.cc.lehigh.edu username@sol.cc.lehigh.edu
  ```
  * [Configure MobaXterm to use the SSH Gateway](https://confluence.cc.lehigh.edu/x/JhH5Bg).

# Traditional Method 

* Requires a SSH Client for logging in and a SCP client for transferring data.

* Users need to write a script to submit jobs.
  - Script needs to be written in Shell - bash, tcsh, csh or sh.
  - Requires knowledge of \*nix commands.
  - Steep learning curve if you only need to use interactive applications such as Jupyter Notebooks and RStudio.

* Most HPC clusters do not have X-enabled i.e. GUI tools cannot be used
  
* Many non-traditional HPC users are put off by these stringent restrictions.

* Need a lower barrier of entry to HPC for _most_ users.

# ![:scale 30%](https://openondemand.org/assets/images/ood_logo_stack_rgb.svg)

* an NSF-funded open-source HPC portal based on Ohio Supercomputing Centerâ€™s original OnDemand portal. 

* Goals: provide an easy way for system administrators to provide web access to their HPC resources, including, but not limited to:
  - Plugin-free web experience
  - Easy file management
  - Command-line shell access
  - Job management and monitoring across different batch servers and resource managers
  - Graphical desktop environments and desktop applications

# Interactive Applications

---

# Virtual Desktop Interface (VDI)

* THERE IS NO X OR DESKTOP ENVIRONMENT INSTALLED ON SOL COMPUTE NODES.

* A singularity image of CENTOS 8 with XFCE desktop environment is used to provide a VDI.
   - Dockerfile and Singularity definition files:   https://github.com/alexpacheco/lurc-ood-desktop
   - Docker Images: https://hub.docker.com/r/alexpacheco/centos8
   
* No - we do not take requests to install your favorite desktop environments.


* [Demo](https://confluence.cc.lehigh.edu/x/g5BVBw)


---

# Jupyter Notebooks

* Launch Jupyter Notebooks with the anaconda module.

* Use your own conda environment provided you have jupyter notebooks installed in your environment

* By default,
   - 1 node per job

* See https://go.lehigh.edu/python for list of available packages in each anaconda/python module.

* [Demo](https://confluence.cc.lehigh.edu/x/G5JVBw)

---

# RStudio

* Launch RStudio Server on compute nodes.

* Underlying R software in not visible via module command.

* Available versions
   - 3.5.3 and 3.6.3
   - 4.0.2 and 4.1.2  with three different sets of package themes
   - See [https://confluence.cc.lehigh.edu/display/hpc/RStudio](https://confluence.cc.lehigh.edu/x/NpBVBw) for list of available packages in each version.

* By default,
   - 1 node per job

* [Demo](https://confluence.cc.lehigh.edu/x/NpBVBw)

# Other Applications


* [Apache Spark](https://confluence.cc.lehigh.edu/x/PJFTCQ)
* [Abaqus CAE](https://confluence.cc.lehigh.edu/x/mKn0BQ)
* [MATLAB](https://confluence.cc.lehigh.edu/x/5ZBVBw)
